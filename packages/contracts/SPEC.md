## Responsibility

The browser↔host wire spine: the single source of truth for the protocol. Types-only, with the only
runtime exports being the WS method/channel constants, the protocol version, and the small config default
(`DEFAULT_CONFIG`). The one package `apps/web` may depend on—which is what lets the UI ship independently
of the host.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** the wire — entity types, the `pi` event/message types (re-exported), the WS method & channel
  registries, and the protocol version. Including **`WsErrorCode`** — the closed set of failures the *host
  names* (`WsResponse.errorCode`, today only `UNKNOWN_COMMIT`), so a client can react to one specific failure
  instead of pattern-matching an error message. A failure earns a code only when a client behaves differently
  for it; everything else stays a plain `error` string. Expected method-specific synchronization outcomes,
  such as a stale layout replacement, remain typed method results rather than generic WS failures.
- **Public surface (`index.ts`):** `export type *` of `piProtocol` + `domain`; the value re-exports
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `MAX_HISTORY_LIMIT`, `MAX_HISTORY_QUERY_LENGTH`, `TODO_NUDGE_PREFIX` +
  **`isControlMessage(text)`** (the one shared reading of that marker — the client hides such sends on
  hydrate, the host skips them in the history index and does not count them as `message_sent`; both
  sides agree here rather than each re-deriving `startsWith`) + **`isRetriedAttempt(messages, index)`**
  (the one shared reading of pi's persisted-but-superseded auto-retry attempts — the client's hydration
  hides their turns, the host's history indexer skips their text; both consume the index slot so jump
  anchors stay aligned) from `domain`; **`isTranscriptMessageRole(role)`**
  from `piProtocol` (the one definition of which roles a transcript carries: the host filters
  `session.getMessages` by it *and* `history` counts `messageIndex` by it, so two copies differing by a role
  would silently shift every later jump anchor); `export *` (value) of `wsProtocol`
  (`WS_METHODS`, `WS_CHANNELS`, the typed maps, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`).
- **Allowed deps:** none at runtime. **Type-only** devDeps on `@earendil-works/pi-ai` +
  `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, imported **from their package roots** (type-only → erased at build).
- **Forbidden:** any *value* import of a `pi` package; **any** import (even `type`) of
  `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (pulls `node:fs`); the pi-ai **provider / API subpaths**
  (`/providers/*`, `/api/*`, `/bedrock-provider`, … — they statically load the Node provider SDKs); and
  importing `server` / `shared` / `web`.

## Contents

- **piProtocol.ts** — `import type` re-exports from the pi package roots (type-only → erased at build):
  - `@earendil-works/pi-ai`: `Model`, `Message`, `UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage`,
    `ToolResultMessage`, `TextContent`, `ThinkingContent`, `ImageContent`, `ToolCall`,
    `AssistantMessageEvent`, `Usage`, `StopReason`;
  - **`WireModel`** = `Pick<Model<string>, "id"|"name"|"provider"|"contextWindow"|"reasoning">` **+ the one
    computed field `thinkingLevels`** (pi-ai `getSupportedThinkingLevels`, mapped host-side in `toWireModel`;
    client→host params carry it inert) — the shape a model takes **on the wire**
    (`model.list`/`model.refresh`/`model.default`, the `session.create` result + params,
    `session.setModel` params, `SessionSummary.model`). An **allowlist** of exactly what the UI renders, *not*
    an `Omit`: extension/provider `Model.baseUrl` and `headers` can carry routing credentials, and an allowlist
    **fails closed** — a future `Model` field (secret
    or not) is excluded by default. The host re-resolves the real `Model` from `{provider,id}` — so a client
    can neither read the secret nor inject a `baseUrl` for the agent to call (see the `agent` module SPEC);
  - `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`: `AgentEvent`, `AgentMessage`, `ThinkingLevel` (the
    `off`-inclusive one);
  - the local render union **`PiEvent`** — the real superset `AgentSessionEvent` lives in the Node-only
    `pi-coding-agent`, so it's **mirrored** here (the `agent_end.willRetry` + `agent_settled` /
    `queue_update` / `compaction_*` / `auto_retry_*` / `summarization_retry_*` /
    `session_info_changed` / `thinking_level_changed` members, plus `bash_execution_update` — mirrored
    for union fidelity only; the host never calls `executeBash`, so the UI never receives it).
    `agent_settled` is a host projection carrying the final attempt's reported terminal metadata
    (`stopReason` + optional `errorMessage`): `agent_end.willRetry` covers provider auto-retry only and
    is not an automatic-work terminal when compaction or a queued continuation follows.
    `compaction_end.result` is typed as **`CompactionEndResult`** — an allowlist mirror of pi's
    Node-only `CompactionResult` carrying exactly what the compaction notice renders
    (`tokensBefore` + optional `estimatedTokensAfter`); the host constructs this projection rather than
    casting pi's richer object wholesale, and wire data remains untrusted, so the reducer guards the field
    shapes rather than assuming them;
  - **`SessionEventPayload`** (`{ sessionId, event: PiEvent }`) — the `pi.event` push frame.
  - the cheap-win mirrors (declared in the Node-only `pi-coding-agent`): **`SessionStats`** + **`ContextUsage`**
    (tokens/cost/context bar — display only) and **`SlashCommandInfo`** + **`SlashCommandSourceInfo`** (the
    command/skill autocomplete catalog, returned by live `session.getCommands` and skill-only pre-session
    `skill.list`), and **`SkillCatalogEntry`** + **`SkillDecision`** (`load`/`untrusted`/`pending-ack`/
    `disabled`) — the workspace Skills manager's `skills.state` rows.
  - **`SessionSummary`** — a chat session as the host reports it for hydration (read side); `live`
    distinguishes an in-memory session (auto-restored) from a disk-only one (surfaced in chat-history,
    re-opened on demand — except one carrying unfinished TODOs, which a client auto-opens). The optional
    **`openTodos`** (count of non-`done` items in the chat's TODO plan) is populated only by
    `session.list` (the host decorates via the todos module); absent = unknown, treated as 0. A live
    summary's optional **`lastSettlement`** retains the host-observed terminal (`null` = the live run is
    active or settled without an assistant) so reconnect can surface a final failure Pi removed from its rebuilt context; absent
    means this host process has not observed a settlement and the persisted transcript is authoritative.
    The optional **`queue`** (**`SessionQueueState`**: pi's pending `steering`/`followUp` texts) rides a
    live summary only when non-empty — the hydration seed for the client's pending strip, since
    `queue_update` fires only on changes and a client attaching mid-run would otherwise never learn of
    messages queued before it connected.
    `session.getMessages` returns `{ summary, messages }` (the transcript is
    **`TranscriptMessage[]`** — the pi-canonical `Message` union widened with **`WireCustomMessage`**, a
    type-only mirror of pi-coding-agent's Node-only `CustomMessage`, so extension-injected messages like
    the ask replies cross the wire, and with **`WireCompactionSummary`** (mirror of the Node-only
    `CompactionSummaryMessage`: `summary`/`tokensBefore`/`timestamp`), the resolved-context record of a
    compaction — pi places it before the kept tail and drops the summarized messages, so forwarding it is
    what makes the compaction boundary survive reload/reopen instead of rendering a transcript that begins
    mid-conversation. The summary reflects the now-live session after a disk re-open). The role universe a
    host may send is pinned by the runtime **`isTranscriptMessageRole(role)`** guard: the single source for
    the server's transcript filter and history index, whose alignment keeps a history hit's `messageIndex`
    valid against the client's `turnIdByMessageIndex` — a role added to one side but not the other would
    silently shift every later jump anchor.
  - the **extension-UI frames** **`ExtUiRequest`** / **`ExtUiResponse`** — our wire shape for pi's in-process
    `uiContext` calls (`select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor` round-trip; `notify`/`setStatus`/`setWidget`/
    `setTitle`/`dismiss` are fire-and-forget), carried on the `pi.extensionUi` channel.
  - the **`ask_user_question`** wire types — **`AskUserQuestionArgs`** (`AskUserQuestionItem` + `AskUserQuestionOption`
    — the latter carries an optional `recommendedReason` the card renders inline as a `Why:` line under the
    option: the questions the agent authors, what the tool card reads from the `toolCall` block),
    **`AskUserQuestionResult`** (`AskUserQuestionAnswer[]` + `cancelled`: the browser's reply),
    **`AskUserQuestionAckDetails`** (the tool result's `details` under the **ack + terminate** design —
    the call resolves instantly; the turn ends) and **`AskUserAnswersDetails`** + the
    **`ASK_USER_ANSWERS_CUSTOM_TYPE`** constant, **`AskUserAnswersMessage`** (the correctly-paired
    tag↔details shape the host's builder is compile-held to) and the shared **`isAskUserAnswersMessage`**
    guard (all in `wsProtocol`, the value-bearing half): the reply travels as an `ask-user-answers`
    custom message the card pairs by `details.toolCallId`. `WireCustomMessage.customType` itself stays
    `string` — the namespace is open (any pi extension can mint custom messages and they all cross the
    wire), so strictness lives at the producer + the guard, which validates the details *shape* (wire
    data is untrusted — another process, possibly another protocol version). The capability
    is a **host-owned pi custom tool** (server `agent/askUserQuestion` — see its SPEC for the design
    rationale); the chat renders the questionnaire **inline** and replies via `session.answerQuestion`
    (correlated by the tool call id; rejected loud when the call is unknown/answered/superseded).
- **domain.ts** — app entities: `Project` (git repo + unique `slug` + optional **`closed: true`** — the
  persisted open-rail membership bit; absence means open for backward compatibility, and closing never
  changes the project's id or deletes its workspace associations — plus the skill-trust fields **`trusted`**
  (the per-project grant), **`acknowledgedSkills`** (re-confirm-new — which committed aliases are OK'd) and
  **`disabledSkills`** / **`disabledGroups`** (project-baseline per-skill and per-group off — a group is a
  plugin, a source tier, or the special `@plugins`), which gate what its skills contribute; a workspace layers
  **`Workspace.skillOverrides`** (per-skill on/off) over that baseline;
  "does it have specs?" is **not** a field — it's the lazy `project.hasSpecs` query, since it's a full-tree
  walk), **`ProjectPathStatus`** (a
  candidate path's kind — `repo` / `initable` / `missing` / `notDirectory` — so the UI opens, offers a
  `git init`, or shows an error), `Workspace` (git worktree; its
  optional **`renamed`** flag is the naming lifecycle — absent = **not yet locked** (either pristine
  `workspace-N`, or a *provisional* non-agentic name the host applied from the first prompt), so still
  eligible for the agentic auto-rename; `true` = deliberately named (agentic or user), never auto-touched
  again; its optional **`kind: "default"`** marks the built-in per-project **Default workspace** — the
  project folder itself as a workspace, exactly one per project, pinned first in `workspace.list`,
  non-removable and non-renamable server-side; **`kind: "external"`** marks an explicitly attached,
  user-owned worktree Mewa Code may forget but must never rename or reclaim; absent = a Mewa Code-managed
  worktree workspace — an explicit wire field, never an id convention),
  **`OpenBranchReview`** (the optional open review reference for the active branch: PR vs MR + number; no status/actions),
  **`ExistingWorktreeCandidate`** (a `workspace.listExisting` row: absolute `path` + `branch`, or a
  `detached` row the chooser disables), `Session` (chat tab),
  `FileNode` (file-tree node), `TabStatus`, `Git*`/diff types — incl. **`GitDiffScope`** (what the Changes
  panel is diffing: `branch` → the workspace's work since diverging from its diff base (the range starts at
  their merge-base, never the base's tip) / `uncommitted` → worktree vs `HEAD` /
  `commit` → one commit, `sha^` vs `sha`; omitted on the wire = `branch`, so an older client is unchanged)
  and **`GitCommit`** (a commit row of the scope menu's list). The two meanings of a workspace's base are
  **two fields**: `Workspace.baseBranch` is *creation provenance* (the ref the worktree was cut from — what
  the receipt's `branch · from baseBranch` shows; for a **user-owned** workspace, whose provenance isn't
  Mewa Code's to claim, it is the repo default as the *initial* review target and the UI shows no `from`)
  and the optional **`Workspace.diffBase`** is the *review
  target* (`workspace.setDiffBase`); every read resolves `diffBase ?? baseBranch` **server-side, in one
  place** — collapsing them into one field would make a re-pointed target lie about where the branch came
  from; **`ProviderStatus`/`ProviderStatusReport`**
  — the auth-provider status rows the Welcome strip renders (per-provider `configured` + auth `kind`:
  oauth / api-key / env / other — never credential values; plus `canOAuth`/`canApiKey`/`canLogout`,
  which gate the strip's in-app Sign-in / Sign-out affordances — `canLogout` is true only for a removable
  auth.json credential, false for env / runtime / models.json auth the host can't unset); the **in-app login wire** — **`LoginFrame`** (the streamed
  flow updates: `authUrl` / `deviceCode` / `select` / `prompt` / `progress` / `success` / `error`, which
  **accumulate** client-side, never a credential value), **`LoginPush`** (the `provider.login` frame,
  `{ loginId, providerId, frame }`) and **`LoginReply`** (`{ loginId, value }` — the browser's answer to a
  `select`/`prompt`). Provider status never carries credentials, executable paths, subprocess output,
  diagnostics, or raw PI models. The host reports only the provider id, display name, configured state,
  auth kind, and the supported in-app actions);
  the **theme/config selection** — **`ThemeId`** is an open string on the wire, because the host persists
  an opaque selection while the independently shipped web client owns the available manifest catalog;
  **`AppConfig`** (`{ theme, terminalReplayKb, layout }` — an extensible bag; `layout` is the
  **`LayoutSettings`** selection (`defaultPresetId`, named portable `customPresets`, and
  `maxSideGroups`, default 6)) carries it with the
  **`DEFAULT_CONFIG`** fallback
  (persisted host-side as `config.json`, delivered in `server.welcome`, mutated via `settings.update`).
  Contracts deliberately exports no theme enum/list/labels: a future manifest can mint an id unknown when
  the host was built, and a client missing it resolves its own bundled default;
  **`SpecGraphNode`/`SpecGraphSnapshot`** — the
  Specs-viewer read DTOs, **mirrored** (like `PiEvent`), never imported from `pi-spec-graph` — the wire
  carries only what the panel renders (`type`/`status` stay `string`: tolerate whatever is on disk);
  **`TodoItem`/`TodoGroupItem`/`TodoPlan`/`TodoArtifact`** + the **`TodoStatus`/`TodoOrigin`/
  `TodoArtifactKind`** unions — the in-chat plan
  DTOs, **mirrored** from `pi-todos/core` (never imported), carrying the chat's per-session TODO list.
  `TodoGroupItem` additionally carries **`status: TodoGroupStatus`** — the group's *task* lifecycle
  (`pending`/`active`/`done`), **derived by the host** from the steps (`pi-todos`' `groupStatus`) rather than
  stored: shipping it means the truth table has one home and no client re-derives it. A `commit`
  artifact additionally carries **`files?: GitFileChange[]`** (path + status + `+/−` — the same rows
  the Changes panel renders at the commit scope) — host-derived from git by `todo.list`'s decoration
  (same one-home rationale), never stored; absent = the sha no longer resolves, degrade silently.
  **history-search read DTOs** — **`HistoryScope`** (the overlay's cycle: this chat → workspace →
  project → everywhere); **`PromptHit`** (a recalled prompt; carries optional `messageIndex` +
  `anchorText` — the kept-newest occurrence's jump anchor) and **`MessageHit`** (a full-text
  conversation match; assistant-only — a user-role hit only ever duplicates its own `PromptHit`'s text,
  so the jump affordance lives there instead; `messageIndex` anchors jump-to-message into
  `session.getMessages` order, `anchorText` makes the anchor drift-tolerant), and
  **`HistorySearchResult`** (the prompts + full-text messages sections, with totals and indexing status);
  the **review DTOs** — **`Review`** (one open review per workspace; `baseSha` — the reviewed diff's
  ORIGINAL side (the branch range's fork point, what that diff actually displays — never the target's
  tip, which can carry upstream commits the review never showed) pinned to a **full commit oid at
  creation**, immutable for the review's life — plus **`fileSessions`**, key → that
  key's review chat: one chat per file, pinned on first send, the **empty key** being the anchorless
  whole-change-set bucket, pinned the same way so a second overall remark continues one discussion —
  and **`doneFiles`**, same keys: files whose review the user marked finished, so a fully-resolved
  file leaves the list only on their say-so), **`ReviewComment`** (`kind`
  inline/diff/file/review; `status` draft/sent/resolved/
  dismissed — orthogonal to **`anchorState`** anchored/moved/outdated; per-comment `sessionId` — the
  chat it was sent into), **`ReviewAnchor`** (`path` + `side` + `contentHash` + an ordered **`ReviewSelector`**
  fallback chain: `lineRange` / `textQuote` / `diffHunk` / `structural` — the last two are forward
  slots V1 authors don't populate; a `side: "base"` anchor additionally carries **`baseRef`**, the ref
  its lines and fragment were captured against, since the two diff sides are two line spaces, plus the
  **`scope`** it was captured in — the diff identity that reopens the one surface rendering that blob),
  **`ReviewSnapshot`** (`{ review, comments }` — the `review.get`
  read and, with `workspaceId`, the `review.changed` push payload **`ReviewChangedPayload`** —
  full-snapshot so replay is idempotent);
  **prompt-template DTOs** — **`TemplateScope`** (`"global"` | `"project"` — where a template lives),
  **`TemplateInfo`** (metadata only: name, optional `description`/`argumentHint`, `scope`, `filePath` —
  what `template.list` returns; deliberately body-free so a listing never ships every file's full text),
  and **`Template`** (`TemplateInfo` + full `content` — frontmatter + body — the by-name
  `template.get`/`template.save` shape);
  **workbench layout DTOs** — a versioned **`WorkspaceLayoutDocument`** (stable center split/group and
  side/group/tab references, normalized geometry, preview identities, folds/visibility, and singleton-tool
  restore targets; explicitly no active/focused tab; virtual-document references name a registered resolver
  and durable source identity, never inline client-only content), **`WorkspaceLayoutSnapshot`**
  (`workspaceId` +
  monotonic `revision` + document), **`LayoutReplaceParams`** (complete document + client-generated
  `mutationId` + explicit `expectedRevision`, where `null` is create-only and a number is exact
  replace-only), **`LayoutReplaceResult`** (discriminated accepted payload or conflict carrying the current
  snapshot, including `null`), **`LayoutChangedPayload`** (snapshot + echoed origin `mutationId`), and
  portable **`LayoutPreset`** / **`LayoutSettings`**. The mutation id is correlation metadata, not the
  concurrency token or durable document state. A tab `id` is an opaque stable placement key—including for singleton tools—not semantic identity;
  the kind-specific path/scope/session/source/tabKey/tool fields define the resource and prevent aliases from
  duplicating it. Resource references carry placement identity only; their domain DTO remains authoritative
  for lifetime.
- **wsProtocol.ts** — `WS_METHODS` (`project.*` — incl. **`project.close`** (mark the stable record
  closed without deleting associated state), **`project.inspect`** (classify a path) + **`project.init`**
  (`git init` + commit, then open) + **`project.hasSpecs`** (lazy per-project "contains a registered
  spec?" for the Welcome screen — a full-tree walk, so requested only for the shown project,
  never eagerly for every project) / `workspace.*` — notably **`workspace.list { projectId,
  includeDiffStats? }`**, where omitted/true preserves the existing full rows with computed aggregates and
  `false` returns the same authoritative membership/order without the synchronous per-workspace diff-stat
  fan-out used nowhere by navigation restoration / `fs.*` / `git.*` / **`spec.graph`**
  (the Specs-viewer whole-graph read, per workspace) / **`todo.*`** — **`list`**/**`add`**/**`update`**/
  **`remove`**, the chat's per-session TODO plan (keyed by `workspaceId` + `sessionId`; `add` tags the
  item `origin:"user"`) / **`terminal.*`** — **`attach`** (idempotent get-or-create keyed by
  `(workspaceId, tabKey)`, returning `created` + the `replay` to repaint; the only way a PTY is born, and it
  replaced `create`+`alive`) / **`list`** (the host owns the tab list) / `write` / `resize` /
  **`close`** (by `tabKey`, refusing a busy shell unless `force`) / `model.list` + **`model.refresh`** (awaits the host's
  single-flighted catalog refresh and returns **`RefreshedModels`** — the post-refresh list plus
  **`complete`**, whether that pass settled inside the host's capped wait, since only a settled list is
  authoritative; `force` bypasses pi's 4h freshness throttle, so a user-initiated refresh actually fetches) / **`model.clampThinking`** (pi's
  `clampThinkingLevel` for a `{model, level}` pair — the pre-session picker's effort adjustment, so no
  client re-derives pi's policy) / **`provider.status`**
(the auth-provider status report; every read revalidates host-side) / the **`provider.*` in-app login**
  (**`loginStart`** — mints a `loginId` and runs pi's login flow **detached** (`type` `"oauth"` |
  `"api_key"`, issue #97 — both auth routes ride one channel; a flow can take minutes and must
  not sit on the request nor block the WS pump) / **`loginReply`** — answers a live `select`/`prompt`,
  correlated by `loginId` / **`loginCancel`** / **`logout`**) /
  **`workspace.listExisting`** (the selected project's unattached Git worktrees, with detached rows
  disabled by status) / **`workspace.openExisting`** (revalidate + register one branch-backed checkout as
  `kind: "external"`, emitting the ordinary `workspace.created`, without mutating Git or disk) /
  **`workspace.openReview`** (the active branch's optional `OpenBranchReview` metadata) /
  **`project.setTrust`** (persist a project's trust grant → the updated `Project`; gates its committed
  cross-agent skill aliases) /
  **`skill.list`** (a pre-session, skill-only `SlashCommandInfo[]` preview for a `projectId`, resolved from
  that project's current checkout with its **project-scoped aliases gated by trust**; the eventual worktree
  session is authoritative) / the **Skills-manager set** — **`project.aliasSkills`** (present committed alias
  names, for the presence-gated notice's count) / **`project.acknowledgeSkills`** (confirm skills that
  appeared after trust) / **`project.setSkillEnabled`** (project baseline) / **`project.setGroupEnabled`**
  (turn a plugin / source tier / `@plugins` on/off at the baseline) / **`workspace.setSkillOverride`**
  (per-workspace on/off/clear → the `Workspace`) / **`workspace.setDiffBase`** (re-point the diff target,
  `null` clears it back to the creation base — echoes the updated `Workspace` **and** broadcasts
  `workspace.updated`, so every client converges on the push) / **`workspace.watchReady`** (await the
  fresh watcher's conservative startup nudge before a skill-loading client captures its freshness baseline;
  `{ startupNudge }` is true unless the watcher was already known ready, so a replayed response can supply
  the client's conservative fallback when the event push was lost or startup failed; an optional
  `prewarm: true` marks the started watcher as prewarm-only — the host keeps those in a globally bounded,
  evictable pool and any real preflight/read promotes them out of it, see the server `watch` SPEC) / **`git.status`** +
  **`git.diffFile`**, both
  taking an optional **`scope: GitDiffScope`** (an unresolvable scope — a commit a rebase removed — is
  *rejected*, which the panel reads as "reset the scope" instead of staying wedged on a dead sha) /
  **`git.listCommits`** (the workspace branch's own commits, `<diff base>..HEAD`, newest first, capped
  host-side — the scope menu's lazily-fetched list) / **`git.prefetch`** (best-effort background fetch of a
  remote base — the New-Workspace dialog's freshness warm-up; always acks `{ ok }`, and when the fetch
  actually moved the local remote-tracking ref the host follows up with pathless `workspace.fsChanged`
  frames to the workspaces whose diff base that ref is, so their git-derived reads re-converge) / **`skills.state`** (`SkillCatalogEntry[]` — full catalog +
  per-skill `decision` + `group` — for a `workspaceId`) / **`project.skills`** (the same, project-scoped, for
  the pre-session manager) / **`session.reloadResources`** (re-scan skills + rebuild the system prompt for one
  running session; rejected while streaming) /
  `session.*` — `create`/`prompt`/`steer`/`followUp`/**`clearQueue`** (drain pi's steering+followUp
  queues, returning the texts — the client's abort-restores-queue path; pi itself emits the emptying
  `queue_update`)/**`removeQueued`** (`{ kind, index }` → `RemovedQueuedMessage`: drop or extract ONE
  queued message — the strip rows' edit/remove; position-addressed because pi's queue entries are bare
  strings with no id, and the host emulates per-item removal over pi's all-or-nothing `clearQueue`, see
  the server agent SPEC)/`abort`/`dispose`/**`delete`**/`setModel`/
  `setThinkingLevel`/`compact`/`getStats`/`getCommands`/`extUiReply`/**`answerQuestion`** (the inline
  `ask_user_question` reply, correlated by tool call id)/**`list`**/**`getMessages`** (the
  read side) / **`layout.get`** (hydrate one workspace snapshot, or `null` before first seeding) /
  **`layout.replace`** (inside the per-workspace serialization queue, compare `expectedRevision` with the
  current snapshot immediately before validation/persistence; accept and atomically replace one complete
  document only on equality, otherwise return a typed conflict with the current snapshot and do not persist,
  increment, or broadcast; accepted snapshots echo the request's mutation id) /
  **`settings.update`** (merge + persist a top-level partial `AppConfig`; when present, `layout` is one
  complete validated `LayoutSettings` value rather than a nested patch; returns the merged config) /
  **`history.search`** (the prompt-recall + conversation-search read; results capped,
  recency-ordered; the messages section is assistant-only — a user-role hit surfaces as a jumpable
  `PromptHit` instead, never a separate `MessageHit`) / the **`review.*` set** — **`get`** (the open
  review + comments, lazily created; re-anchored on read) / **`commentAdd`**/**`commentUpdate`**/
  **`commentDelete`** (authoring + manual resolve/dismiss; delete is DRAFT-only — a sent comment is a
  record, and resolved is final: no reopen and no
  worktree rollback on the wire; `commentAdd` takes the diff tab's
  `scope`, which is what lets the host resolve a base-side anchor's `baseRef` — and is persisted on the
  anchor) / **`sendComment`** (one comment → its FILE's review chat, created on the file's first send
  then `followUp`ed) / **`sendBatch`** (all/selected drafts, grouped per key into each key's chat;
  answers with **every** session it touched, in group order — naming only the first left the other
  chats invisible while their comments already read as sent) — both carry **`ReviewSendResult`**: `session.create`'s shape
  plus **`reused`**, the one fact only the host knows (was this chat followed up into, or created now?).
  A reused chat may be one the client has never seen — a second client, or this one after a reload,
  since review state and pi transcripts both outlive the host — so it must be HYDRATED, not opened as
  new; opening it as new shows a blank conversation for comments already marked sent / **`fileDone`**
  (mark a fully-resolved file's review finished; rejected while anything is unresolved — a new
  comment re-opens the file) / **`close`** (the atomic Clear: archive the current review's non-draft
  records, discard drafts, replace the active review, and publish the fresh open snapshot to every client)
  — plus
  **`template.*`** — prompt-template CRUD
  (**`template.list`**, **`template.get`**
  — `scope` optional, project wins over global, **`template.save`**, **`template.delete`**) — all
  read/write pi's prompt dirs (global + project), so templates stay CLI-portable,
  `WS_CHANNELS` (`server.welcome` — which carries the initial `config: AppConfig` alongside **`projects`**
  (open records) and **`recentProjects`** (all known records, open + closed) / **`project.updated`** — the
  full persisted `Project` snapshot after open/reopen/close, including `closed` membership, so every client
  atomically converges its rail + Recents without optimistic removal / `pi.event` / `pi.extensionUi` /
  **`session.deleted`** (workspace + session id; a non-replayable domain event broadcast after permanent
  deletion so every client removes the chat and blocks stale hydration) /
  **`settings.changed`** (the full `AppConfig`, broadcast so every client
  converges) / **`layout.changed`** (the full accepted `WorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` plus origin mutation id;
  idempotent by monotonic revision and broadcast to every client) / **`provider.login`** — the session-less
  in-app login stream (a `LoginPush`
  per frame, keyed by `loginId`; the sibling of `pi.extensionUi`, since a login runs on the Welcome screen
  before any session exists) / **`provider.changed`** — a data-free invalidation broadcast after the
  host-authoritative provider status or current model generation changes;
  clients re-read `provider.status` and invalidate `model.list`, so no raw provider/model data rides the push /
  `terminal.data` + **`terminal.exit`** + **`terminal.detached`** (the only
  **addressed** channels — sent to the single *attached* client rather than broadcast, so a shell's bytes never
  reach another browser; `terminal.data` may carry `truncated` when the host had to drop held output,
  `terminal.detached` says another client took the tab over) / the **workspace lifecycle
  trio** — **`workspace.created`**
  / **`workspace.updated`** / **`workspace.removed`** — registry membership changes fanned out to every
  client so it stays shared domain state (architecture #9), all emitted by the server's `workspaces`
  publisher (never a per-client optimistic mutation). `created`/`updated` carry the **full persisted
  `Workspace` snapshot** (idempotent under the transport's last-value replay, so e.g. the auto-rename's
  naive-then-agentic pair merges by `id` — never a delta); `removed` carries a **`WorkspaceRemoved`** id
  pair (`{ projectId, id }` — the record is already gone) / **`review.changed`** — a workspace's review
  state changed (emitted by the server's `reviews` publisher on every mutation — UI edits, agent
  `resolve_comment` calls, re-anchoring — so all clients converge, same pattern as the trio) /
  **`workspace.fsChanged`** — the worktree
  change-notifier push (**`WorkspaceFsChangedPayload`**: `{ workspaceId, paths, truncated, skillChange }`,
  worktree-relative deduped paths, capped — `truncated` means the generic path list is incomplete and must
  be treated as a wildcard; `skillChange: "none" | "detected" | "unknown"` is an **independent semantic
  fact**, accumulated before that cap, so a concrete non-skill overflow stays `none`, a skill path omitted
  after the cap stays `detected`, and only a pathless platform/startup uncertainty is `unknown`; a pathless
  non-truncated/`none` frame is a whole-workspace invalidation such as repo-metadata drift); an
  **invalidation nudge, not data**: clients re-read via the existing read methods, so a duplicate/replayed
  frame is harmless.
  The `WsMethodMap` typed request/result map +
  `WsParams`/`WsResult` helpers, and `PROTOCOL_VERSION`. Request ids are also the reconnect idempotency key:
  an unresolved client replays the same frame/id, and the host returns the one cached result for
  `(clientKey, requestId)` instead of executing the handler again. Two client→host frames that are *not* requests close
  that loop (hence **`WsClientMessage`**, discriminated on the key): **`WsAck`** (`{ ack: string[] }`) names
  responses the client has *read* — the only thing that distinguishes a reply the page received from one that
  died in a socket buffer, and so the only thing that lets the host free a retained result — and **`WsResume`**
  (`{ resume: string[] }`), sent on every (re)connect ahead of the replays, names the complete set the page
  still considers unresolved, so the host can release everything else. `resume` exists because a receipt is only
  as reliable as the socket carrying it and nothing would ever re-send a lost one: restating the live set beats
  confirming the confirmations. This behavior is protocol-versioned — a replaying UI must never run against a
  pre-dedup host.

## Get right

- **Mirrors are not version-pinned in comments.** A shape re-declared here because its real home is
  Node-only carries *what* it mirrors, never *which pi version it was last checked against*: those
  markers had to be hand-edited across several files on every bump and nothing verified them. A
  UI-relevant lifecycle member must be explicit here (especially the host-enriched `agent_settled`);
  UI-irrelevant session events such as `entry_appended` may remain unmodelled and ignored. Re-audit a
  mirror when a bump's changelog touches it, not because a comment names a version.
- **Type-only, from the package roots, always** (type-only imports are erased by
  `verbatimModuleSyntax`, so the web bundle stays provider-free; the pi-ai provider/API subpaths
  statically import the Node SDKs — never touch them). The `/base` entries existed only in 0.79.8–0.79.9.
- `Model` is generic — expose as `Model<any>`.
- `AssistantMessageEvent` (the streaming deltas) is nested under `message_update.assistantMessageEvent`,
  never a top-level event `type`.
- Internal relative imports are **extensionless** (`./domain`), not `./domain.ts` — `composite` emits
  declarations, which is incompatible with `allowImportingTsExtensions`.
- **Bundle gate:** `bun build` the web app and confirm **no** `@anthropic-ai/sdk` /
  `openai` / `node:fs` appears.

## Consumed by

`web` (types + WS constants) and `server` (same, + mapping `session.*` to `AgentSession` methods). The
shell panels need `domain` + `wsProtocol`; the `pi` types + `PiEvent` are the wire for the agent session.

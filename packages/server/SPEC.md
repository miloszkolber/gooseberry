## Responsibility

The engine host as an embeddable library. Serves the browser↔host wire (`Bun.serve` HTTP+WS, static SPA)
and runs the `pi` agent in-process via `createAgentSession`. Launched in-process by `apps/cli` (and later
`apps/desktop`); it has no standalone entrypoint of its own (a `dev.ts` boots it for development / e2e).

## Boundary

- **Owns:** the HTTP+WS server, static serving, the WS dispatch registry, server-side feature services
  (project/workspace/git/fs/terminal + the in-process `AgentSession` manager), and `~/.mewa-code`
  persistence.
- **Public surface:** `createServer(options) → Promise<RunningServer>` (`{ port, stop }`) — the public
   factory initializes the in-process PI runtime before binding a socket or exposing handlers, so every
   embedder gets the same bootstrap invariant — and
  `bootHost(options) → BootedHost` (the process-boot wrapper: resolves the login-shell PATH, pre-warms the
  same initialization before choosing a port, awaits
  `createServer`, and installs SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful-shutdown handlers), both re-exported from
  `host/`; plus `registerBundledRuntime` (+ its types, re-exported from `agent/`) — the compiled-binary
  seam by which a launcher that cannot path-load the bundled pi extensions (no `node_modules` inside a
  `bun build --compile` binary) injects them as value-imported factories + a staged skills dir, injects
  the staged macOS/Windows OS-trash helper paths, and registers pi's statically-bundled provider flows
  (the OAuth flows + the Bedrock module) that pi otherwise reaches through binary-hostile
  variable-specifier dynamic imports (see the agent SPEC). The
  package also exposes the **`@mewa-code/server/agent` subpath export** (the `agent` barrel): the
  server-side session surface for the **headless workflow-test harness** (`e2e/workflows/`), which
  drives real in-process sessions through the production wiring without booting the HTTP host — a
  deliberate second entry that avoids evaluating `host` (Bun-only: `Bun.serve`, `bun-pty`) under the
  node-run e2e worker. Not for `apps/*` use — the web/CLI boundary rules are unchanged.
- **Allowed deps:** `contracts` (types + WS constants), `shared` (`shellEnv`), `bun-pty`,
  `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` + `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (runtime), Bun/Node.
- **Forbidden:** importing `web`/`cli`/`desktop`; being bundled into the browser.

## Internal modules

Each lives in `src/<name>/` as a bounded sub-module: a `SPEC.md` (its own boundary) + an `index.ts`
**barrel** that is its only public surface. Siblings import a module **through its barrel, never its
internals**. The edges between them are owned here (see the dependency graph), not in the leaf specs.

| module | owns | spec |

| `assist` | ad-hoc one-shot tasks (workspace naming, …) on a cheap model, best-effort | [assist/SPEC.md](src/assist/SPEC.md) |
| `dialog` | the host's native folder picker | [dialog/SPEC.md](src/dialog/SPEC.md) |
| `editors` | detect installed editors/IDEs, launch one at a worktree, reveal a worktree in the file manager | [editors/SPEC.md](src/editors/SPEC.md) |

| `templates` | file CRUD over pi's prompt-template dirs (global + project scoped) | [templates/SPEC.md](src/templates/SPEC.md) |

`src/index.ts` re-exports `host` + the `agent` barrel's `registerBundledRuntime` seam; `src/dev.ts` boots
the host from env via `bootHost` for dev/e2e.

## Internal dependency graph

`host` is the **only composition root** — it wires each feature's handlers into the WS registry.

- `host` → `projects`, `workspaces`, `git`, `github`, `branch-review`, `fs`, `spec`, `todos`, `reviews`, `watch`, `terminal`, `dialog`, `editors`, `agent`, `auth`, `assist`, `settings`, `layout`, `history`, `templates`, `persistence` (`dataDir`, for the crash report)
- `workspaces` → `projects`, `git`, `persistence`
- `branch-review` → `git`
- `projects` → `git` (shared runner), `persistence`
- `git`, `fs`, `spec`, `watch`, `terminal`, `settings`, `layout` → `persistence` (`spec` also → `pi-spec-graph/core`, external)
- `todos` → `workspaces` (worktree path lookup) + `pi-todos/core` (external, value-imported, pi-free)
- `reviews` → `workspaces` (worktree path lookup), `persistence` (data dir), `git` (the review's baseSha
  resolve, plus the diff range + blob read behind a base-side anchor). The `review.send*` flows are
  **composed in `host`'s handlers** (reviews builds the package, `agent` runs the session — no
  `reviews`→`agent` edge; `host` serializes sends *and* review mutations per workspace via
  `reviewLock`, and re-attaches the review's persisted chat via `agent.ensureSessionAttached`), and the
  agent-side `resolve_comment` tool delegates back through a seam
  `host` installs (`agent.setReviewCommentHandler` → `reviews.resolveCommentFromAgent`)
- `assist` → `agent` (the one-shot completion primitive)
- `auth` → `agent` (the current runtime/auth facade plus candidate prepare/activate; one-way, `agent` never imports `auth`)
- `agent` → (no internal deps — only the pi runtime)
- `persistence`, `dialog`, `github`, `history`, `templates` → (leaves)

Rules: features never import `host`, and never each other except the edges above. The graph is acyclic.
`agent`'s WS surface (`session.*` + `pi.event` forwarding) attaches to `host`. Features that push on their
own never import `host` either: they expose a **publisher-injection seam** (`setTerminalPublisher`,
`setSessionPublisher`, `setLoginPublisher`, `projects`' `setProjectPublisher` for the full-snapshot
`project.updated` lifecycle, `workspaces`' `setWorkspacePublisher` for the
`workspace.created`/`updated`/`removed` lifecycle trio, `settings`' `setSettingsPublisher` for
`settings.changed`, `layout`'s full-snapshot publisher for `layout.changed`, and auth's
`provider.changed` invalidation publisher) that `host` installs at `createServer` — so channel wiring lives only in
`host`.
For layout writes, `host` passes `settings.getConfig().layout.maxSideGroups` into the `layout` validator;
for layout-setting writes it runs the complete nested value through `layout.validateLayoutSettings` before calling `settings`.
Neither sibling imports the other.
`history` stays registry-free (never imports `projects`/`workspaces`); `host` injects the scope filter
+ labels from the registries at the handler layer (`history.search` handler). `templates` stays
registry-free too — it takes a plain `cwd`, never a `workspaceId`; the `template.*` handler resolves
`workspaceId` → `cwd` via `workspaces` before calling into `templates`.

## Get right

- **No process isolation** — a fatal agent/provider fault takes the whole host down (accepted tradeoff).
- **WS commands return values directly**; only events + extension-UI use push channels.
- Binds beyond localhost via `host` option (the Tailscale seam).

## Later

Persistence behind a data layer (V2), `owner` threading.

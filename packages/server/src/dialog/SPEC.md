## Responsibility

The host's native directory picker, so the browser "Open project" gets a real OS dialog.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `selectDirectory()` — the host's native folder picker, per OS via `pickersFor(platform)`:
  macOS `osascript` (`choose folder`), Linux `zenity` then `kdialog` (whichever is installed), Windows a
  PowerShell `FolderBrowserDialog`. `MEWA_CODE_PICK_DIR` overrides it for
  dev/e2e; returns `null` when the user cancels. A missing binary falls through to the next candidate; a
  non-zero exit is a cancel for `osascript`/`zenity`/`kdialog` but a **failure** for PowerShell (it exits 0
  on cancel) — each `Picker` declares which. A failed picker, or no runnable candidate at all, **throws**:
  the picker is the only way to add a project, so a silent `null` is a dead button.
  **File-indirection:** when `MEWA_CODE_PICK_DIR` names an existing
  *file*, the returned path is that file's trimmed contents, **re-read per call** — so one shared e2e host
  can hand different folders to different tests by rewriting the pointer (a directory value is returned
  as-is).
- **Windows: the dialog must come up focused, in front of the browser.** The host is a background
  process, and Windows only lets the process that *owns* the foreground call `SetForegroundWindow` — so a
  plain `ShowDialog()` opens behind the browser, unfocused, reading as "the button does nothing". An
  invisible top-most owner form is **not sufficient on its own**: measured on Windows 11 with an unrelated
  app in front, the dialog came up unfocused in 3/3 runs — visible, but the keyboard still belonged to the
  browser. What works is the documented way past the foreground lock: the script `AttachThreadInput`s to
  the foreground window's thread (sharing its input queue makes our `SetForegroundWindow` legal),
  foregrounds the owner form, detaches, then shows the dialog **owned** by that now-foreground form.
  Measured on Windows 11: focused and on top in 3/3 runs, Enter selects the highlighted folder, Escape
  returns `null` at exit 0. The whole grab is **best-effort** — wrapped so a host that can't compile the
  P/Invoke, or an elevated foreground app that refuses the steal, degrades to the old behaviour (the
  dialog still opens, just behind) instead of failing the pick.
  The script is handed over as `-EncodedCommand` (base64/UTF-16LE), not `-Command`: it is multi-line and
  contains the double quotes of P/Invoke signatures, which Windows argv quoting plus PowerShell's own
  re-parse do not preserve.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `selectDirectory` (+ `pickersFor` / `Picker` and the two message builders
  `pickerFailure` / `noPickerMessage`, exposed for unit tests).
- **Allowed deps:** Bun (spawn), `process.env`.
- **Forbidden:** `host`; sibling features; `contracts` (none needed).

## Responsibility

The in-process `pi` engine: a current shared model/auth runtime generation for pre-session work and future
chats, the lifecycle of `AgentSession`s (one per chat tab, rooted in a workspace's worktree and retaining the
runtime generation they were created with), Pi resource/skill loading (including portable
cross-agent skill discovery + a pre-session skill catalog), the **extension-UI bridge** that turns pi's
in-process `uiContext` dialog calls into WS frames, the host-owned **`ask_user_question`** tool + its
answer-injection path, and the **restart repair** that keeps re-opened transcripts provider-valid.

## Boundary

- **Owns:**
  - `piRuntime` (the current shared `ModelRuntime` generation — pi's canonical model/auth facade for
    catalogs, credentials, availability, login/logout, and request dispatch). Sibling consumers use the
    `usePiRuntime()` callback to capture the current generation rather than receiving a mutable singleton;
     host boot initializes it before any model work, while explicit runtime preparation can atomically activate
     a fresh generation. Tests configure the factory before initialization. Every runtime is created
    with **ambient network OFF** —
    `allowModelNetwork: false` **plus a scoped `PI_OFFLINE` around construction** (pi 0.81 derives the
    runtime's ambient-network default from that env at construction; the option now gates only the
    create-time refresh — in 0.80.x it fed both; the scoped value is restored immediately, a user-set
    one untouched — pinned by `piRuntime.test.ts`): catalog reads stay local (builtins + models.json +
    the persisted models-store), because a network-enabled `refresh()` (pi 0.82 folded the old
    `reloadConfig()` into it) awaits remote pi.dev catalog
    checks with no timeout — on the `provider.status` and host-boot paths that stalls wherever
    egress is slow or blocked. The one deliberate opt-in to
    live catalogs is the single-flighted **`refreshCatalogs(runtime)`** (issue #98, mirroring pi's own
    `/model`) behind two triggers: a detached task from `model.list` only
    (`listAvailableModels` fires it, then serves the current snapshot — the picker read never awaits the
    network; broader triggers — `model.default`, host boot — were considered and declined) and
    **awaited** via `model.refresh` (`refreshAvailableModels`, the picker's freshness affordance: await
    the refresh, then serve the post-refresh snapshot **with `complete`** — `refreshCatalogs` resolves a
    `CatalogRefreshOutcome` saying whether the pass it waited on settled, and that verdict travels to the
    client as `RefreshedModels.complete`, because a capped wait can only promise a *current* list, not a
    settled one, and catalog authority must key on the difference). Per-call `refresh({ allowNetwork: true, force })`,
    where **`force` is the caller's intent, not a constant**: an *implicit* trigger (`model.list`, opening
    the picker) leaves it off and pi's **4h provider freshness throttle** decides whether anything is
    fetched, while a *user-initiated* refresh (the picker's Refresh row → `model.refresh({force:true})`)
    bypasses it — inside that window pi returns early **before issuing any request at all** (its
    `If-None-Match` revalidation included), so an unforced explicit refresh would fetch nothing at all. **Single-flight per runtime instance** (pi's
    `refresh()` doesn't dedupe concurrent calls) **keyed with the kind**: an implicit caller joins any
    pass, a forced caller never joins a throttled one (it would inherit the no-op) and instead queues
    behind it. The **15s budget** (pi's model-selector one) is applied **twice**, both on **unref'd**
    timers (must not hold a shutting-down host or a test process open): as `models.refresh`'s **abort**
    signal (a hung refresh must self-expire or single-flight would wedge) *and* as the ceiling on what a
    **caller awaits**, because the signal bounds neither pi's unsignalled `forceRefreshAvailability()`
    fan-out after it nor a forced pass queued behind a throttled one — without it one slow provider leaves
    every picker's refresh row spinning. A timed-out caller serves the registry as it stands (reporting
    `completed: false`) while single-flight keeps tracking the unbounded pass (so it cannot start a second concurrent refresh); failures emit only a closed generic/count `console.warn` (never provider ids or errors) + are swallowed, never the picker's problem; **`PI_OFFLINE`**
    (pi's env convention) disables it — resolving as a *completed* pass, since with nothing fetchable the
    registry as it stands is the settled answer; the e2e webServer env and the manager's unit suite set it for
    hermeticity. The **provider-credential surface** over this runtime —
    `provider.status` + in-app login — lives in the sibling `auth` module (which consumes the shared
    `usePiRuntime` callback), **not** here.

     Candidate preparation builds a fresh runtime, applies the composition root's invariant generation
     initializer (the source-mode e2e host uses it for its gated fake providers), records the provider-id
     allowlist for `provider.status`, and then applies the configured extensions once through PI's public
     headless loader. The initializer must be configured before the first generation and runs for every
     candidate. Initializer, extension, loader, and provider failures discard the candidate and collapse to a
     closed `candidate-failed` outcome. Raw diagnostics never reach `pi.extensionUi`, the wire, persistence,
     or snapshots. Agent owns preparation and activation of a generation.

    Activation changes the current pointer for pre-session reads and future session creation; it never mutates,
    drains, or recreates existing sessions. A live session keeps its original runtime generation. A disk session
    attached after activation resolves its persisted `{provider,id}` exactly against the new current runtime—
    missing is an error, and PI's `createAgentSession` fallback is never allowed to choose a different model.

    Every models **read** goes through **`settledAvailableModels(runtime)`** — pi's
    `getAvailableSnapshot()`, **never `getAvailable()`**: that one awaits `refreshAvailability()`, which
    returns the pending per-provider auth fan-out *or starts one*, all unsignalled — so reading through it
    would hand `model.list` (whose contract is to answer without touching the network), `model.default` and
    every inbound model-ref check an unbounded wait, and would escape the refresh deadline one line after
    applying it. The snapshot is what pi's last *settled* pass concluded (written at `create()`, after every
    `refresh()`, and on login/logout), and being the one read makes the picker, default, and model resolution
    agree within a generation.
  - `agentSessionManager` — sessions keyed by `session.sessionId` (each `Entry` also tracks its
    `workspaceId`), `createSession({ cwd, workspaceId, model?, thinkingLevel? })` → `createAgentSession(...)`
    with a per-session `SessionManager` **and a `buildSessionSettings(cwd)` settings manager** (the user's
    real settings + an in-memory `images.autoResize:false` override — never persisted — so the `read` tool
    sends image files **raw**, bypassing pi's photon/WASM resizer that the single-file binary can't bundle;
    the web UI downsizes user-attached images itself at attach time — `apps/web`'s `chat/imageAttachment`
    caps the long edge at 1568px — and the `imageGuard` extension below is the in-context second line of
    defense); a shared `registerSession` publishes each event
    tagged with its id + `bindExtensions({ mode:'rpc', uiContext })`. The event projection retains the
    final `agent_end` assistant's reported terminal metadata and attaches it to `agent_settled`, so the
    wire has one authoritative automatic-work terminal even when compaction/retry happens between those
    events; it forwards rather than re-derives pi's result. A `compaction_end` is separately projected to
    a **fresh allowlisted event**: its `result` carries only `tokensBefore` and optional
    `estimatedTokensAfter`, never pi's summary, entry id, usage, or extension details. The live entry retains
    that settlement in `SessionSummary.lastSettlement` for reconnect after Pi removed a failed attempt from its rebuilt
    context; a new `agent_start` exposes explicit `null` (no current terminal) so an older persisted failure
    cannot reappear mid-run, while disk sessions remain transcript-authoritative. A live summary also
    carries pi's queue snapshot (`SessionQueueState`, only when non-empty): `queue_update` fires only on
    changes, so this is the read-side seed that lets a client attaching mid-run render messages queued
    before it connected.
    New-session and pre-session entrypoints capture the current generation; operations on a live session use
    that session's retained runtime. `abort` remains available as the cancellation control path.
    `prompt`/`steer`/`followUp` (with images) /
    — **both `promptSession` and `followUpSession` resolve the delivery mode against the session's
    LIVE `isStreaming`, never the caller's belief about it**: `prompt()` throws mid-turn (so it falls
    back to `steer`), and pi's `followUp()` only *enqueues* into a queue that a run already in flight
    drains (so on an idle session it falls back to `prompt`, else the message parks forever — the way a
    `review.sendBatch` into a re-attached review chat marked its comments sent to an agent that never
    saw them) / **`clearQueueSession`** (pi's `clearQueue()`, verbatim: drains both queues and returns the
    texts for the client's dequeue-to-composer; pi emits the emptying `queue_update`, so the host adds no
    bookkeeping) / **`removeQueuedSession(sessionId, kind, index)`** — per-item queue removal, which pi's
    API lacks (queues are bare string arrays, `clearQueue` is all-or-nothing): drain via `clearQueue()`,
    drop `lane[index]` (out-of-range → `removed: null`, everything re-queued), re-queue the keepers in
    order (`steer()`/`followUp()` per lane — each re-queue emits its own `queue_update`, so clients
    converge by events alone). **No-loss guarantee:** if the run settled during the operation the
    re-queued keepers would park forever (pi's queues only drain inside a run), so the idle case drains
    them through the same idle-delivery fallback as `followUpSession` — the first becomes a `prompt`,
    the rest steer into the run it starts; delivery timing may degrade across that race window, content
    is never lost (pinned by the idle-fallback unit test) —
    `setModel` / `setThinkingLevel` / `compact` / `getSessionStats` (+ contextUsage) / `getSessionCommands` /
    `listAvailableModels` / **`clampThinkingForModel`** (pi's `clampThinkingLevel` for a `{model, level}`
    pair — `model.clampThinking`; the host owns it so the pre-session picker, `getDefaultModel`, and a live
    session all adjust effort identically) / `getDefaultModel` (the model + thinking a fresh session resolves to — settings
    default if available, else first available — so the New-Workspace dialog shows the exact pre-session
    model). **Models cross the wire as `WireModel` (never pi's raw `Model`):** `toWireModel` projects a
    `Model` onto the wire's **allowlist** (see `WireModel`) — so `baseUrl`, `headers`, extension/provider
    routing data, and any other field are excluded by
    default — and the inbound side re-resolves the ref by `{provider,id}` via `resolveWireModel` against
    **`settledAvailableModels`**: `createSession` uses the current generation, while `setModel` uses that live
    session's retained runtime. Therefore a model newly shown in the global picker can be unavailable to an
    older live chat and fails with a closed model-unavailable error rather than crossing generations. Pi uses
    `Model.baseUrl` verbatim, so a client's baseUrl
    is never trusted (blocks disclosure *and* arbitrary-URL injection). The **hydration read side** —
    `listSessions(workspaceId, cwd)` (live sessions
    **unioned with on-disk** ones pi persisted under `cwd`, live winning on id → `SessionSummary[]` tagged
    `live`; before treating the **detached** disk list as authoritative it strictly scans every transcript
    header and verifies pi returned every file, so an unreadable/malformed/skipped file rejects the read
    rather than masquerading as absent and being tombstoned by reconnect reconciliation. A registered live
    session's own exact `SessionManager.getSessionFile()` path is excluded from that disk preflight: its
    in-memory entry is already authoritative, and pi may truncate/rewrite that path while the host lists,
    so treating the transient physical state as a detached corrupt chat would blank every chat on reload) +
    `getSessionMessages(sessionId, workspaceId, cwd)` (re-opens a disk session into the manager if
    not live, first resolving any model named by the transcript exactly in the active process runtime and
    rejecting with a closed error when that named model is unavailable—never accepting PI's silent fallback
    for an existing model reference; legacy transcripts with no persisted model reference may use the
    configured default—then returns `{ summary, messages }` —
    `TranscriptMessage[]`: the pi-canonical subset **plus
    `custom` messages**, which carry the `ask-user-answers` replies the questionnaire card pairs by tool
    call id, **plus `compactionSummary`**, pi's durable marker for the messages compaction summarized away —
    kept precisely because pi's resolved transcript is all that survives, so dropping it would hand the
    client a chat that starts mid-conversation with nothing to explain the gap. Which roles those are is
    **not decided here**: the filter is contracts' `isTranscriptMessageRole`, shared with `history`'s index
    so the two cannot drift and shift `messageIndex`), plus **`ensureSessionAttached(sessionId, workspaceId, cwd)`** — the same single-flighted
    re-open with no transcript read, for a caller that only needs the session *promptable* again (the
    review send's follow-up into an existing chat). It answers **`false` only when the id names no transcript
    in that cwd** — the sole case a caller may recover from by starting a new chat — and **throws** on
    every other re-open failure, so a merely-unreadable session can never be mistaken for an absent one
    and silently forked; the disk half is what survives a host **restart** — and re-attaching runs
    **`repairDanglingToolCalls` (the `sessionRepair` sibling) BEFORE `createAgentSession` seeds its
    context**: a host death mid-tool leaves an assistant message with unpaired `toolCall`s, every provider
    rejects such a context (the chat would brick), and appending behind a live session would desync its
    in-memory state — so orphans are paired at the one choke point every post-restart session passes.
    Generic orphans get pi's abort convention (`isError` "Operation aborted (host restarted…)"); an
    old-format dangling ask gets the canonical decline + a re-ask hint (`details {answers:[],
    cancelled:true}`), so its card hydrates as the normal skipped record;
    **`answerQuestion(sessionId, toolCallId, result)`** — the `ask_user_question` reply path (see the
    `askUserQuestion` bullet); **`settleSessionsForShutdown(timeoutMs)`** — the polite half of shutdown:
    abort every streaming session and wait (bounded) so pi persists their "Operation aborted" tool results
    before `process.exit` (the launcher's SIGINT/SIGTERM handler awaits it; whatever misses the window is
    healed by the restart repair); `getSessionWorkspaceId(sessionId)` (the live session→workspace
    lookup the host's auto-rename hook keys on); `removeSession`/`disposeAllSessions`;
    **`removeWorkspaceSessions(workspaceId, cwd?)`** (the **archive teardown**: abort a streaming turn,
    then dispose every live session for the workspace **unconditionally** — bypassing the per-chat delete
    guard that `removeSession` enforces, so a chat whose recoverable delete is mid-trash cannot abort the
    teardown loop and strand its siblings — then delete pi's on-disk transcripts rooted at
    the worktree `cwd` — pi's `SessionManager` is append-only, so purge = `list(cwd)` then `rm` the files
    whose recorded `cwd` matches, never `rm -rf` the encoded dir since pi's cwd→dir encoding can alias
    distinct cwds; `cwd` omitted on a double-archive skips only the disk purge);
    **`deleteSession(sessionId, workspaceId, cwd)`** (mark it deleted before any await so an in-flight disk
    attach cannot register afterward; that tombstone also makes a retained live entry non-addressable to
    **every session command, including `session.dispose`, for the full delete transaction**, so another
    client cannot append a turn behind the pending trash move or destroy the rollback target. **The
    transaction is single-flighted per session id**: a concurrent second trash click (another tab/client)
    for the same chat joins the running transaction (or is rejected as unknown when a foreign workspace
    names the id) rather than starting a rival one — two owners of the shared tombstone would let the
    loser's failure roll it back mid-move and briefly re-open the chat — and **only the transaction that
    installed the tombstone clears it on failure**, so an earlier successful deletion's permanent tombstone
    survives a later spurious re-delete. Abort a live turn if needed but retain the live entry, resolve a
    live transcript from that session's own `SessionManager` (never a lossy directory listing), otherwise
    use the same strict disk lookup above, move the exact matching-cwd transcript to the OS trash via
    `trashFile`, then dispose the live entry and publish `SessionDeletedPayload` for client convergence;
    a newly created empty live chat whose reserved JSONL path has not materialized has nothing recoverable to
    trash and is disposed directly. Any lookup or trash failure throws, rolls back the tombstone it installed,
    restores command access to the same
    transcript/live entry, and publishes nothing; there is deliberately no permanent-unlink fallback behind
    a recoverable UI action);
    `setSessionPublisher` + `setSessionDeletedPublisher` + `setSessionManagerFactory` seams.
  - `oneshot` — one-shot LLM completions **without** an `AgentSession` (no tools/extensions/disk):
    `completeOnce(request)` picks a model from the shared runtime's authenticated set and dispatches a
    single `runtime.completeSimple()` — pi's canonical provider-agnostic request path, which resolves
    the model's auth itself (OAuth refresh included) and also serves providers that only implement
    `streamSimple` (extension-registered ones). `pickModel(tier)` = the model choice: `cheap` prefers a
    curated small/fast allowlist ∩ the authenticated set, else the cheapest by per-token cost; `default`
    = first available; `null` when nothing is authenticated. This is the primitive the `assist` tasks
    (workspace naming, PR drafting) run on — the only place model **dispatch** happens outside a session.
  - `webUiContext` — `createWebUiContext(sessionId)` builds the `ExtensionUIContext` pi calls (dialogs
    round-trip to the browser, fire-and-forget methods push, TUI-only members inert); `setExtUiPublisher`
    (server→client push seam), `resolveExtUi` (browser reply), `cancelExtUiForSession` (on dispose),
    `notifyExtUi`.
  - `askUserQuestion` — the host-owned **`ask_user_question`** pi custom tool (`createAskUserQuestionTool`,
    registered on every session via the `askUserQuestionExtension` factory in `extensions`), designed
    **ack + terminate** so a questionnaire survives host restarts: `execute` renders nothing and **awaits
    nothing** — it guards on `ctx.hasUI`, runs the pure `validateQuestionnaire`, then immediately returns
    the ack (`details {kind:"ack"}`) with **`terminate: true`**, ending the turn at the tool batch with no
    further LLM call. Nothing pends in memory, the transcript is complete and provider-valid the moment
    the ack lands, and the session is genuinely **idle** while the user thinks — restarts need no
    question-specific handling at all. The reply arrives over `session.answerQuestion` → the manager's
    `answerQuestion(sessionId, toolCallId, result)`: it vets the reply against the transcript with the
    pure **`assessAnswerability`** (unknown call / already answered / `not_awaiting` legacy-final results /
    **superseded** — a later free-form user message replaced the answer, so the card is terminal and a
    stale answer **fails loud**, never parks), then injects **`buildAnswersMessage`** — an
    **`ask-user-answers` custom message** (`ASK_USER_ANSWERS_CUSTOM_TYPE`, `details {toolCallId, result}`,
    text = the same `buildQuestionnaireResponse` envelope the blocking design fed the model; a partial
    submission lists its unanswered questions explicitly as declined) — via pi's public
    `AgentSession.sendCustomMessage({triggerTurn: true})`, which starts a new turn when idle and steers
    the current one when streaming. **Answering live and answering after a restart are the same code
    path.** The questionnaire is rendered **inline** in chat by `apps/web`'s `AskUserQuestionCard`
    (joined by tool name; lifecycle derived from the transcript — see the chat tools SPEC).
    **Rejected alternatives** (the one place these decisions are recorded): (1) the original **blocking
    design** — `execute` parked on an in-memory promise until the browser replied. A host restart
    destroyed the pending promise and left a dangling `toolCall` in the transcript; providers reject
    unpaired `tool_use`, so the chat **bricked** on every later prompt, and post-restart answers rotted in
    a held-answers map. The shutdown handler's synchronous `process.exit` made this deterministic, and
    questions block on human timescales — restarts during the window are the common case, not the edge.
    (2) A **suspended-session** variant (write the real result at answer time; tolerate the dangle while
    waiting) — needs two different answer mechanisms (resolve-blocked-promise live vs
    heal-file-then-attach post-restart), keeps a deliberately-invalid on-disk state every consumer must
    tiptoe around, and pi exposes no public turn-resume from a bare tool result anyway. (3) Bundling the
    community `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question` extension — its questionnaire UI is a live pi-tui
    component handed to the host via `ctx.ui.custom(factory)` (*code, not data*), unserializable over the
    WS bridge; and like every blocking ask-extension it inherits the restart hole. The LLM-facing contract
    (TypeBox schema, validation, envelope — mirroring rpiv's so the model behaves the same) stays
    re-implemented here so we own it and avoid the package's pi-tui/i18n peer deps.
  - `sessionRepair` — `repairDanglingToolCalls(sessionManager)`: the restart safety net (rationale under
    the manager bullet above). Pure over pi's `SessionManager` (compaction-aware via
    `buildSessionContext`; idempotent; appends at the leaf, where orphans sit by construction) —
    unit-tested against `SessionManager.inMemory`.
  - `imageGuard` — the oversized-image guard: an inline extension (`oversizedImageGuard`, one of
    `buildResourceLoader`'s shared factories) hooked on pi's **`context` event** (fired before every LLM
    call, live sessions included). **Anthropic-family only**: the caps are Anthropic's model-level rules,
    so the handler gates on the context's active model (`isAnthropicFamilyModel` — native
    `anthropic`/`anthropic-messages`, or a Claude model id through Bedrock/Vertex/aggregators; unknown
    model ⇒ no-op) and every other provider's image context passes through untouched. It sniffs each image block's pixel dimensions straight from the base64
    header bytes (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP — no codec, never strips what it can't sniff; **bounded work per
    pass**: only a 256KiB decoded prefix is ever materialized — a JPEG whose SOF lies beyond it sniffs as
    unknown, not stripped — and each block is sniffed exactly once per pass) and replaces any block
    violating a provider rule with a text note naming the violated rule plus a re-attach hint. Five
    rules, in order: the **provider-accepted media types** (`ACCEPTED_IMAGE_TYPES`, shared with the
    composer via `contracts` — pi forwards an image's media type verbatim, so a legacy `image/heic`
    block 400s the whole request; stripping it heals sessions poisoned before the composer refused such
    files); the **4.5MB encoded-base64 payload ceiling** (`IMAGE_MAX_BASE64_BYTES`, shared
    with the composer via `contracts` — pi's own headroom under Anthropic's 5MB API limit, compared
    against `data.length` since the wire carries base64, so it applies even to unsniffable formats); the **8000px per-side hard cap**; the **count-aware 2000px cap** once the
    whole context carries more than 20 images — stripping changes the very count that selects that cap,
    so 2000px violators are stripped **largest-first only until the survivors fit back under the
    threshold** (18 small + 3 at 2500px ⇒ one stripped, the other two stay legal under 8000px); and the
    **request-wide `REQUEST_IMAGE_BASE64_BUDGET`** (24MB of base64, headroom under Anthropic's 32MB
    per-request cap — several per-image-legal blocks can still overflow the whole request), enforced by
    stripping survivors **largest-first until the aggregate fits**. This is what un-bricks a session poisoned by an oversized image
    (history is re-sent every turn, so one bad image 400s forever): sessions are append-only and the host
    has no image codec (the autoResize tradeoff above), so the guard transforms the **outgoing context
    only** — session file and transcript stay untouched, and a stuck chat recovers on its very next
    message. The count-aware cap also degrades a raw >2000px `read`-tool image to a note instead of a
    brick once a session crosses 21 images. Pure core (`guardOversizedImages`, `imageDimensions`)
    unit-tested with hand-built header bytes.
  - `extensions` — Pi resource wiring. `buildResourceLoader(cwd, settingsManager)` resolves Pi's normal
    settings/package + `.pi` / `.agents` extension set and explicitly loads the configured paths. Sessions use
    the provider objects already owned by their retained generation, so extension factories cannot mutate a
    session's model generation. All user extensions
    retain normal discovery. The loader then adds
    automatic **portable cross-agent skill aliases**, then loads the five bundled extensions — **`pi-web-access`**
    (`web_search` + `fetch_content`), **`pi-visualize`** (`visualize`), **`pi-spec-graph`** (the `spec_*`
    tools + its `before_agent_start` rule), **`pi-mewa-code-workflow`** (the workflow-router rule +
    workflow skills), and **`pi-todos`** (the `todo_*` tools + its skill). Existing personal aliases are Claude
    (`${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/skills`), Codex (`${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills`), Copilot
    (`~/.copilot/skills`), and Gemini (`${GEMINI_CLI_HOME:-~}/.gemini/skills`), **plus each installed Claude
    plugin's `skills/` dir** (read from `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` — the resolved `installPath`,
    never a cache sweep, so stale versions and transitive `node_modules/**/skills` are excluded); project-root
    aliases are `.claude/skills`, `.github/skills`, and `.gemini/skills`. The pure
    **`isProjectSkillPath(relativePath)`** predicate is the one server-side definition used by the worktree
    watcher (injected through `host`): it recognizes those aliases plus Pi's native `.pi/skills` and
    `.agents/skills`, so capped filesystem batches carry truthful skill-change evidence without making
    `watch` depend on `agent`. The fixed project/personal alias roots are registered as candidate skill paths
    **whether or not they exist yet**, so a `loader.reload()` picks up one a branch switch / pull / clone
    creates mid-session (plugin dirs are the set installed at construction — a plugin added later
    needs a fresh session); classification still only counts dirs that actually exist. Still never arbitrary
    dot-directory scanning, plugin caches, commands, or nested downward discovery. Pi remains the parser:
    vendor-only macros/hooks/models/subagents/metadata are not emulated. First-name-wins precedence is
    Pi native/configured/shared → Mewa Code-bundled → personal aliases → project aliases, so a repo can
    never shadow your own or Mewa Code's skills; source metadata preserves truthful `project` / `user` scope.
    **Admission gate (`skillAdmission`):** committed **project-scoped** aliases are attacker-controlled for a
    clone and injected into the system prompt, so per-skill they resolve to `load` / `untrusted` /
    `pending-ack` / `disabled` from an **admission context** — the project's `trusted` + `acknowledgedSkills`
    (granting trust acknowledges only what's present, so a later pull/branch skill is `pending-ack` until
    confirmed) + `disabledSkills` / **`disabledGroups`** baselines (a group key = a plugin name, a source tier
    `project`/`personal`/`bundled`/`pi`, or the special `@plugins` — assigned per skill by `skillGroup`, matching
    `SkillCatalogEntry.group`), layered with the workspace's per-skill `skillOverrides` (the trust gate is
    checked before the toggle layer, so an "on" override can never un-gate an untrusted alias, and a per-skill
    `on` beats a group disable). `skillsGate` filters + relabels in one `skillsOverride`; only `load` skills
    reach the system prompt / `/skill:` list.
    The host resolves the context via the **`setSkillAdmissionResolver`** seam (keyed by `workspaceId`, fails
    closed); `buildResourceLoader` takes the resolver as a thunk and `skillsGate` re-resolves **both** the admission
    context (`getCtx`) **and** the live compatibility source set (fresh discovery) on every `loader.reload()`, so
    `session.reloadResources` picks up a mid-session trust grant, skill/group toggle, **or a newly-appeared alias
    dir** — and a late-appearing project alias is still classified + trust-gated, never slipping through as an
    unclassified load. Personal / bundled / pi-native resources are never trust-gated (only the enable/disable layer);
    the gate is scoped to the compatibility aliases (pi-native `.pi` / `.agents` project trust is unchanged).
    `listSkillCommands(cwd, admission)` reuses the same gated inputs through a short-lived skills-only
    `DefaultResourceLoader` (no model/session/transcript, no extension factories) for pre-workspace
    autocomplete, cached briefly per `(cwd, admission)`; **`listSkillCatalog(cwd, admission)`** is the Skills
    manager's unfiltered variant (every discovered skill + its `group` + `decision`) — driven with a workspace
    (via `skills.state`) or a project (via `project.skills`, current checkout, no overrides) — and
    **`listProjectAliasSkillNames`** is the notice's present-alias count. The full session loader supports
    **two modes**:
    - **Run-from-source (default):** `additionalExtensionPaths` pointing at the packages' raw `.ts`
      entries (pi's loader jiti-loads them — no value-import into our typecheck graph), resolved
      **lazily on first use** (never at module load: the resolve requires `node_modules`, which a
      compiled binary lacks). The workspace packages' `pi.skills` manifests aren't auto-discovered for
      file-path entries — their `skills/` dirs (`pi-spec-graph`, `pi-mewa-code-workflow`, `pi-todos`) are
      wired via **`additionalSkillPaths`**.
    - **Compiled binary:** the launcher awaits the **`registerBundledRuntime({ factories, skillsDir,
      trashHelpers })` seam** before the first session — the same bundled extensions as
      **value-imported default-export factories** (pi gives `extensionFactories` full API parity with path loading; what's lost —
      file-relative `baseDir`, per-reload re-evaluation — none of them use) plus a staged on-disk
      skills dir (pi reads `SKILL.md` via plain fs, so skills must live on the real filesystem). The
      seam also performs the **binary-only pi registrations**: pi hides Node-only provider code behind
      bundler-opaque variable-specifier dynamic imports (so browser bundles can't reach `node:http`
      OAuth servers / the AWS SDK), which a single-file binary can't resolve at runtime — every OAuth
      sign-in died with `Cannot find module './openai-codex.js'`. pi ships static registration seams
      for exactly this, and we mirror pi's own binary entry (`pi-coding-agent` `dist/bun/cli.js`):
      **`registerBunOAuthFlows()`** (`@earendil-works/pi-ai/bun-oauth`) + **`setBedrockProviderModule(
      bedrockProviderModule)`** (`…/compat` + `…/bedrock-provider`). Both load via **dynamic literal
      imports inside the seam** — literal specifiers are statically bundled by `bun build --compile`,
      while dev (which never calls the seam) never loads the flow modules or the AWS SDK. Registration
      lands in the same `pi-ai` instance pi consults at login time because the catalog pins one exact
      `pi-ai` version repo-wide (one store entry → one bundled module instance). Chat trash has two
      artifact seams behind the same registration: the wrapper statically installs `@stroncium/procfs`'s
      `processMountinfo` parser because `trash`'s Linux path reaches it through a binary-opaque
      template-literal CommonJS `require`; and the launcher stages `trash`'s `macos-trash` /
      `windows-trash.exe` helpers to real executable paths and injects them as `trashHelpers`, because the
      package's internal `new URL(…, import.meta.url)` points inside `/$bunfs/` after compilation. The
      wrapper executes an injected helper on macOS/Windows and otherwise delegates to `trash`; source mode stays on
      `trash` entirely. No platform degrades to permanent unlink.
     Both modes append `extensionFactories`: a **headless-search policy** (a `tool_call` hook defaulting
    `web_search`'s `workflow` to `"none"`, since pi-web-access would otherwise open a browser curator our
    `rpc` host can't render), `askUserQuestionExtension` (registers the `ask_user_question` tool), **and**
    `oversizedImageGuard` (the context-level image-size guard, see the `imageGuard` bullet).
    Both session paths pass it as `resourceLoader`. `buildResourceLoader` stays internal; the seam +
    its types are on the barrel.
- **Public surface (barrel):** the manager operations (incl. `answerQuestion` +
  `settleSessionsForShutdown`) + `CreateSessionInput`/`CreateSessionResult` + `SessionEventPayload`;
  the runtime-generation facade (`usePiRuntime`, candidate prepare/activate, current generation id, and the
  closed `candidate-failed` outcome—no manager internals) plus `configurePiRuntime`/factory test seams and the
  pre-bootstrap `configurePiRuntimeGenerationInitializer` composition seam;
  `completeOnce`/`pickModel` +
  `OneShotRequest`/`OneShotResult`/`ModelTier`; the `webUiContext` seams; the `askUserQuestion` pure
  helpers (`validateQuestionnaire`/`buildQuestionnaireResponse`/`assessAnswerability`/
  `buildAnswersMessage`); `repairDanglingToolCalls`; the skill catalog helpers
  `listSkillCommands(cwd, admission)` (filtered, pre-session autocomplete) / `listSkillCatalog(cwd, admission)`
  (unfiltered, the manager's `skills.state`) / `listProjectAliasSkillNames(cwd)` (present-alias count) /
  `isProjectSkillPath(relativePath)` (watch-classification predicate);
  `reloadSessionResources(sessionId)` (active-chat reload); the **`setSkillAdmissionResolver`** seam (host
  wires `workspaceId` → the admission context);
  the compiled-binary seam (`registerBundledRuntime` +
  `BundledExtensions`/`BundledExtensionFactory`).
- **Allowed deps:** `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (runtime); `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (types + test
  fixtures + **pure catalog helpers value-imported from the package root** — today exactly
  `getSupportedThinkingLevels` + `clampThinkingLevel`, data-only projections over `Model`; *dispatch*
  still goes through the shared `ModelRuntime`, never pi-ai's stream/complete — plus the `/bun-oauth` + `/bedrock-provider`
  + `/compat` subpaths, value-imported **only** inside `registerBundledRuntime`'s dynamic imports); `pi-web-access` + `pi-visualize` + `pi-spec-graph` +
  `pi-mewa-code-workflow` + `pi-todos` (the bundled extensions — loaded by path, never value-imported here; the
  compiled binary's value-imports live in `apps/cli`'s generated build module); `typebox` (the
  `ask_user_question` parameter schema); `trash` (the cross-platform OS recycle-bin implementation;
  called with globbing disabled and allowed to throw — never degraded to `unlink`);
  `@stroncium/procfs` (directly pinned solely for the compiled Linux trash parser inclusion seam);
  `contracts` (`PiEvent`/`Model`/`ThinkingLevel`/`ImageContent`/`SessionStats`/`SlashCommandInfo`/`ExtUi*`/
  `AskUserQuestion*`/`ProviderStatus*`); Node.
 - **Forbidden:** `host`; sibling features (the `cwd` is passed in, not looked up via `persistence`).

## Get right

- `prompt()` throws while a session is streaming → `promptSession` falls back to `steer()`.
- Errors arrive via the event stream + thrown methods, not a crash signal — wrap + forward.
- **A re-opened disk session is repaired before it is seeded** (`repairDanglingToolCalls` between
  `SessionManager.open` and `createAgentSession`) — never append to a session file behind a live
  `AgentSession`, its in-memory context would desync.
- **The ask tool never blocks and never holds state** — anything "pending" about a questionnaire must be
  derivable from the transcript alone (that's what makes restarts free); reply validity is
  `assessAnswerability`'s verdict, computed from `session.messages`, and rejections fail the WS request
  loud.
- Share one **current** `ModelRuntime` for pre-session reads and new sessions. Every session receives and
  retains its generation as `createAgentSession`'s `modelRuntime`; give each its own `SessionManager` and
  `dispose()` it on removal. Old runtimes remain reachable only through old live sessions and become
  collectible with them; `AgentSession.reload()` is resource-only and never changes generations.
- **A `pi` `Model` must never cross the wire raw** — provider/extension configuration may carry secrets in
  `baseUrl`, headers, auth, or provider closures. Every model-bearing frame (`model.list`/`model.refresh`/`model.default`, the
  `session.create` result, `SessionSummary.model`) goes through `toWireModel` — the list paths share the
  one `readAvailableWireModels` read so the projection can't be bypassed by adding a caller; every inbound
  model ref (`session.create` /
  `session.setModel`) is **re-resolved** host-side by `{provider,id}` (`resolveWireModel`), never trusted.
  The wire type `WireModel = Pick<Model, id|name|provider|contextWindow|reasoning> + thinkingLevels` is an
  **allowlist** — it fails closed, so a future `Model` field can't leak by default (a unit test pins the
  exact key set). `thinkingLevels` is the one computed field: pi-ai's `getSupportedThinkingLevels(model)`
  mapped at the same choke point, so the effort picker renders pi's per-model support truth without the
  client re-deriving it.
- A live slash-command list is derived from the **same three sources Pi's rpc mode uses**
  (`extensionRunner.getRegisteredCommands()` + `promptTemplates` + `resourceLoader.getSkills()`). The
  pre-session catalog maps only `resourceLoader.getSkills()` through the same skill→command helper and
  applies the **same project-trust gate**, so New Workspace preview and a real session cannot disagree
  except for the accepted base-branch/current-checkout timing difference.
- Dialog promises honor abort/timeout and are settled (+ dismissed in the UI) on session disposal — a
  bridged `uiContext` call must never hang.
- **Prompt-template `/name` expansion** — typed-through references like `/name args` in a prompt ride
  the agent's default `expandPromptTemplates: true` (no agent code change). It expands from the
  session's **create-time template snapshot** — a template saved mid-session is **NOT** seen by an
  already-open session's typed-through path (pi passes unknown `/name` text through verbatim). The
  composer's `/` menu path is always fresh via `template.list` (see `templates/SPEC.md` freshness rule).

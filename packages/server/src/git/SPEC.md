## Responsibility

Git plumbing: the low-level `git` runner (sync + async) plus a worktree's changed files and diffs over a
**diff scope**, that scope's single definition (the range resolver), a project repo's branch list for the
branch pickers, the workspace branch's own commit list, and a background prefetch that warms a remote base
ref off the workspace-create critical path.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `git(cwd, args)` (spawn git *sync*, capture trimmed stdout/stderr + ok; `opts.raw` keeps
  stdout byte-exact for file-content reads) and `gitAsync(cwd,
  args)` (its async twin — `Bun.spawn`, off the event loop, for network-bound ops like `fetch` that must
  not block the host);
  **the scope→range resolver** — `resolveDiffRange(ws, scope?)` → `DiffRange` — **the one definition of what
  a `GitDiffScope` means** (`branch`: `git diff <merge-base(base, HEAD)>` + untracked, sides = **fork
  point** ↔ worktree — what the workspace changed *since diverging*, so a base that advanced underneath it
  (a fetch moving `origin/main`, upstream work landing) never surfaces as phantom changes; while the base
  hasn't diverged the merge-base *is* its tip, and a failed `merge-base` (missing base, unrelated
  histories, unborn `HEAD`) falls back to the raw ref, keeping the old error surfaces — and keeping the
  file list ancestry-consistent with `listCommits`' `base..HEAD`;
  `uncommitted`: `git diff HEAD` + untracked, sides = `HEAD` ↔ worktree; `commit`: `git diff <sha>^ <sha>`, no
  untracked, both sides from history — a **root** commit degrades to `git show --format=` with an empty
  original, the same add-style degradation an absent path already gets; `pinned`: `git diff <oid>` +
  untracked, sides = the given immutable commit ↔ worktree — the review sidebar's base-side
  navigation, validated exactly like a `commit` sha, same `UNKNOWN_COMMIT` rejection). Both reads build their argv from it
  through `changedFileArgs(range, mode)`, so the file list and a file's two sides can never disagree on the
  range — and that argv brackets its revs on **both** sides: **`--end-of-options`** ahead of them (no ref can be
  re-parsed as a git option) and a trailing **`--`** after them (a rev that also names a path on disk — a branch
  called `docs` — is read as a rev instead of failing the command as an "ambiguous argument"). A **failed**
  `git diff`/`git show` **throws**; it is never reported as an empty change set (see Get right). A `commit` scope's `sha` is validated **twice** — shape (hex-oid regex, so a crafted value can never
  reach a git argument as an option or a path) then existence (`rev-parse --verify`, whose full oid is what is
  then used) — and a vanished commit throws a **`CodedError("UNKNOWN_COMMIT")`** (`@mewa-code/shared/codedError`),
  which the host puts on the wire as `WsResponse.errorCode` and the client turns into "reset the scope, with a
  toast" — *only* for that named failure, never for a timeout or an unnamed host failure;
  **`isSafeRef(ref)` / `assertSafeRef(ref)`** — the shape check every **user/repo-supplied ref** passes at its
  mutation door (`workspaces`' `createWorkspace` base — the **resolved** one, including the value read off the
  repo's own `HEAD` — + `setWorkspaceDiffBase` target). The rule set is `git check-ref-format`'s, reproduced
  in-process (no spawn on a validation path): non-empty, no leading `-`, no whitespace/control chars, no `..`,
  no revision metacharacters (`~ ^ : ? * [ \`), no `@{` and no bare `@`, no empty path component, no component
  starting with `.`, no `.lock` suffix, no trailing `.` or `/`. A name git itself refuses is never one we accept
  — and, symmetrically, **no length cap**: `check-ref-format` has none, so a long hierarchical branch the repo
  really has (and `for-each-ref` really lists) stays selectable; length is not a safety property, and the real
  limits (filesystem component cap, argv size) fail loudly as a read error instead of "malformed". The threat is an **untrusted
  repository**, not a malicious client: `git update-ref` accepts a name like `refs/heads/--output=x` (only the
  `git branch` porcelain refuses it), `listBranches` reads refs with `for-each-ref`, so an option-shaped
  branch reaches the picker of any repo the user opens — and browsing someone's repo is the product's job;
  **`diffBaseRef(ws)`** — `diffBase ?? baseBranch`, the single collapse of a workspace's two base meanings
  (creation provenance vs review target), consumed by the resolver and `listCommits` (the `workspaces`
  module's `diffStats` reaches it *through* the resolver — see Get right);
  **`resolveCommitOid(worktreePath, ref)`** — the full commit oid a ref names right now, or `null`. The one
  place a symbolic ref is FROZEN, and every caller that must still mean the same thing later goes through
  it: the review's `baseSha`, a base-side comment's `baseRef`. A scope's
  `originalRef` is not already immutable (`uncommitted` is the literal `HEAD`; a `branch` scope degrades to
  the raw base ref when `merge-base` fails), so storing one verbatim lets the content move under whoever
  stored it;
  `gitStatus(workspaceId, scope?)` — changed files over the range plus untracked (only when the range ends at
  the worktree), each carrying per-file `added`/`removed` line counts (`git diff --numstat`, its rename-mangled paths resolved
  via `numstatPath` to match `--name-status`; binary rows dropped; untracked files count their whole
  content as added) for the Changes tree's `+/−` badges;
  `gitDiffFile(workspaceId, path, scope?)` → `{ original, modified }` — both sides of one file's change for
  the center Monaco diff tab (`original` = the file at the range's start ref, raw, empty when absent there —
  untracked/added, a renamed file's new path, or a root commit — degrading to an add-style diff; `modified` =
  the worktree file (empty when deleted) for a range ending there, else the commit's own tree; the path is
  escape-checked against the worktree root); **`listCommits(workspaceId)`** → `{ commits: GitCommit[] }` —
  `git log <diff base>..HEAD`, newest first and capped, one `--format` line per commit whose fields are separated
  by a **NUL byte** and read at **fixed arity** (the leading four positionally, everything after them joined back
  as the subject). NUL is the one byte the repository-controlled text cannot smuggle in: an author ident carries
  neither NUL nor newline, so no crafted `%an` can shift `%cI` or truncate itself, and a `%s` that carried one
  would land in the tail anyway. (`%an` is free text *between* the structured fields and the subject, which is
  why "structured fields first" was never enough — an author named `a<sep>2020-01-01T00:00:00Z` shifted the
  subject one field over.) Free-text fields are then stripped of control characters **and of invisible
  deception** — bidi overrides/isolates, zero-width and format characters — before they go on the wire, while
  ordinary international text and emoji survive;
  an unreadable range (deleted base, unborn HEAD) degrades to an empty list so the scope menu still offers its
  other scopes; `listBranches(projectId)` → `{ local, remote,
  defaultBranch }` (local `refs/heads`, remote `refs/remotes/origin` minus `origin/HEAD`, default =
  `origin/HEAD`→`origin/main`→repo `HEAD`); **`resolveDefaultBranch(repoPath)`** — that default-branch
  resolution factored out (named once), shared by `listBranches` and the `workspaces` module's
  Default-workspace ensure (its `baseBranch`); its last fallback is `currentBranch`, so an unborn `HEAD`
  resolves to the branch name it will become, never the literal `"HEAD"` (which would persist into a
  user-visible `baseBranch`); **`currentBranch(repoPath)`** — the branch a checkout currently has out
  (`symbolic-ref --short HEAD`, unborn-safe; detached → literal `HEAD`), consumed by the `workspaces`
  module for a user-owned workspace's folder-truth `branch`, with **`tryCurrentBranch`** its fallible form
  (`null` when the path is not a readable worktree root, so a refresh never persists an I/O failure as a
  detach); **`canonicalPath(path)`** — the symlink-resolved form any path compared against git output must
  take (git resolves symlinks, a caller's path does not), shared with `workspaces`' worktree-identity
  checks; `prefetchBranch(projectId, ref)` — best-effort background
  `git fetch` of a remote ref (via `gitAsync`, branch passed after `--` so a `-`-prefixed name can't be
  parsed as a git option), so a later `createWorkspace` branches off a fresh tip without the network
  round-trip on its critical path (non-`origin/` ref / offline → no-op). Its result also says whether the
  fetch **`moved`** the local remote-tracking ref (first appearance included; compared on the
  fully-qualified `refs/remotes/…` — the exact ref a fetch updates — so a local branch literally named
  `origin/<b>` can't shadow the check via git's DWIM order): a moved ref *may* change what a sibling
  workspace's branch-scope diff means (its merge-base can move), and it is invisible to the `watch` module
  (the write lands in the project repo's shared `.git`, outside every watched location) — so the
  `git.prefetch` handler uses `moved` to fan out the host's pathless `fsChanged` nudge (`host`'s fsNudge
  seam; an unaffected re-read is an idempotent no-op). `moved` is host-internal; the wire response stays
  `{ ok }`;
  **`readBlobAt(worktreePath, ref, path)`** → the file's byte-exact content at a ref, or `null` when the
  read produced none (the diff sides degrade that to `""`; the `reviews` module uses it to capture and
  render a base-side anchor's own content);
  **`gitCommitPaths(workspaceId, message, paths)`** → `{ sha } | null` — commit **exactly `paths`** as one
  commit for the TODO change-set feature (see [[submodule-server-todos]]): stage them (`git add -A --
  <paths>`, so a deletion stages as one), then `git commit --no-verify -- <paths>` (the host's commit must
  not run/fail the user's hooks; author/committer stay the user's git config — it's their branch), and
  return the new sha. **Only the named paths** — never "whatever is dirty now": the caller passes the set
  it proved belongs to the item (and, being its filtered delta, it never contains `.mewa-code/`), so dirt
  that appears between the caller's `gitStatus` and this call cannot be swept in, and the user's other
  staged work stays staged rather than riding along. The paths are **literal filenames, never pathspecs**:
  every path-consuming command runs `--literal-pathspecs`, so a tracked file whose *name* is pathspec
  magic or a glob (`:(top)*`) can't expand beyond the proved delta and defeat the exact-path guarantee or
  the `.mewa-code/` exclusion. **The index is preserved across failure:** the
  checkout's real index **file** (`rev-parse --git-path index` — per-worktree in a linked worktree) is
  snapshotted byte-for-byte before staging and written back on every failure path, so a skipped commit
  leaves the user's staging area exactly as it was — *including index-only state a tree round-trip would
  drop* (an intent-to-add entry from `git add -N` has no tree representation, so a `write-tree`/`read-tree`
  snapshot would silently unstage it). Staging succeeds but committing is fallible (an unset identity, an
  unavailable signing key), and a best-effort feature must not leave the user's next commit carrying files
  they never staged. An index with unmerged entries (a conflicted merge in flight) bails out untouched; a
  half-merged worktree is nothing to auto-commit anyway. Returns `null` for an empty path set, when those paths had nothing to commit
  (`git diff --cached --quiet -- <paths>`), or on any git failure — the caller (`todos/artifacts`) treats
  that as "fall back to path-list artifacts" and never lets it throw. It is the one git primitive that
  **writes** the user's branch; the caller serializes it per workspace.
  **`gitHeadSha(workspaceId)`** → `string | null` — `rev-parse HEAD` (`null` on an unborn HEAD), recorded
  into the todos baseline sidecar at `in_progress`.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `git`, `gitAsync`, `gitStatus`, `gitDiffFile`, `readBlobAt`,
  `gitCommitPaths`, `gitHeadSha`, `listCommits`,
  `resolveDiffRange`, `changedFileArgs`, `diffBaseRef`, `resolveCommitOid`, `DiffRange`, `isSafeRef`,
  `assertSafeRef`, `listBranches`, `resolveDefaultBranch`, `tryCurrentBranch`, `currentBranch`,
  `canonicalPath`, `prefetchBranch`.
- **Allowed deps:** `persistence` (workspace + project lookup); `contracts` (`Git*`/`BranchList` types);
  `@mewa-code/shared/codedError` (naming a failure for the wire); Bun (spawn).
- **Forbidden:** `host`; sibling features.

## Get right

- **A scope is defined once.** Any new read that has to know what "the diff" is goes through
  `resolveDiffRange` — never its own `git diff <base>` line — and any read of the base ref goes through
  `diffBaseRef`, so `diffBase ?? baseBranch` exists in exactly one place in the codebase.
- **A commit scope validates that the commit *exists*, not that it is still reachable** from the branch. A
  rebase or reset can rewrite history out from under a selection; the object is still there, and showing its
  diff is *more* useful than silently resetting the user to "All changes". Which commits are *offered* is the
  scope menu's job (`listCommits`), not the read's — so no read pays for a `merge-base --is-ancestor` pair.
- **A failed read is an error, never "no changes".** `gitStatus` (and its `--numstat` pass) honours the exit
  code: a diff that could not run throws, so the panel keeps its last good list and says the refresh failed
  instead of rendering an empty change set. The `workspaces` module's `diffStats` follows the same rule from
  the other end — it returns *no* stats (and logs why) rather than a fabricated `+0 −0`. A review surface that
  calls a dirty worktree clean is the worst failure this product can have.
- `gitStatus` reports the **live** current branch for a user-owned (`kind: "default" | "external"`)
  workspace (its branch moves out-of-band — a terminal `git checkout` — and the persisted snapshot
  self-heals only at list time; the Changes header must not lag).

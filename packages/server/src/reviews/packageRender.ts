- Edit the worktree files directly with your normal tools; read any file you need — the fragments above are excerpts, not the whole picture.
- After you have addressed a comment (by an edit, or by an answer when no change is needed), call resolve_comment with its id and a one-line note of what you did.
- If a comment is unclear or you disagree, reply in the conversation instead of editing, and do NOT resolve it.
- A comment marked outdated includes the fragment as it was when the comment was written — verify against the current file first.
- A comment with side="base" points at the PRE-change version of the file: its lines and fragment index base-ref, not the worktree. It is a remark about what the change removed or replaced — find the corresponding place in the current file before editing.`;

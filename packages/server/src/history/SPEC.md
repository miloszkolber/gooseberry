## Responsibility
The `history.search` backend: a **lazy in-memory index** over pi's session JSONL files (prompt recall +
full-conversation matches). Enumerates and reads session files **itself** (async `readdir`/`stat`/
`readFile`, replicating pi's pinned discovery layout below) — it must **never call
`SessionManager.listAll()`** on any search/refresh path: `listAll` reads and JSON-parses *every session
file in full* just to build its `SessionInfo`s (`messageCount`/`allMessagesText` we never use), so an
index refresh through it costs the whole corpus even when nothing changed, on the event loop every live
session shares. **Never writes** session files. Because discovery walks every pi session on disk, the
host handler's `all` scope (`host/historyScope.ts`'s `filter = () => true`) deliberately surfaces pi-CLI
sessions outside any registered Mewa Code workspace too — a bit more than `session.getMessages` itself
ever exposes for a single session, but consistent with an owner-scoped host (no multi-tenant isolation
to preserve).

## Design
- `extract.ts` — pure JSONL→`ExtractedSession | null` (`extractSession`): the session's identity
  (`id`/`cwd` from the header, mirroring pi's own rejection rule — the first parseable entry must be a
  `type: "session"` header with a string `id`, else `null`), its `title` (the **latest** `session_info`
  entry's name, including explicit clears — the same latest-wins rule as pi's `buildSessionInfo`), and its
  `HistoryEntry[]` — all from **one parse**, so the index never needs a second source (`listAll`) for
  metadata. Pi session files are **trees** (abandoned branches) that compaction rewrites, so it resolves
  the file the way pi does before the client renders it — `parseSessionEntries` →
  `migrateSessionEntries` → `buildSessionContext` (follow the current leaf, apply the latest compaction,
  drop summarized/abandoned entries) — then indexes the resolved messages, filtered through contracts'
  **`isTranscriptMessageRole`**, the very guard `getSessionMessages` sends by (one policy, not a local copy
  of it). So `messageIndex` matches the client's `turnIdByMessageIndex` exactly
  (no raw-file-order drift), and abandoned/summarized text never becomes a hit — the compaction summary is
  sent (it renders the client's compaction marker), so it consumes an index slot without being searchable.
  The internal
  `TODO_NUDGE_PREFIX` control message (hidden from the transcript on hydrate) is skipped after its index
  slot is consumed, so alignment holds; a **superseded auto-retry attempt** (the shared
  `isRetriedAttempt` reading from contracts — an errored assistant immediately followed by another
  assistant, the adjacent shape pi's `_prepareRetry` produces,
  which hydration renders as no turn / null anchor) is skipped the same way, so a
  failed partial's text never becomes a hit that could only resolve to "couldn't locate the message". Entry text is **full, never truncated** — a hit's `text` is what
  recall inserts and what the overlay's preview presents as the whole prompt, so a cap would silently
  corrupt recall of long pasted-log prompts and make terms past the cutoff unsearchable (the memory
  precedent is pi itself: `SessionInfo.allMessagesText` holds every session's full text in memory). Tool
  results/thinking not indexed (V1).
- `historyIndex.ts` — `HistoryIndex`: cold build on first search (async per-file IO yields the event loop;
  blocks the search up to a budget, then returns partial with `indexing: true`). Discovery is its own
  async enumeration (see "pi file format" below for the pinned layout): a custom `sessionDir` is a flat,
  non-recursive dir of `.jsonl` files; the default root is `<agentDir>/sessions` — agent dir resolved
  **per refresh** via pi's exported `getAgentDir()`, which reads `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` live — holding one
  level of per-cwd directories, including top-level symlinks Pi treats as candidate directories. Broken
  or non-directory symlinks degrade to the same unreadable-directory empty result as Pi. Freshness = `(mtime, size)`
  revalidation throttled to ~2 s (pi appends live messages to the file, so the file IS the live feed — no
  agent-module hook; size is compared alongside mtime so an append landing in the same coarse mtime tick
  still reloads); only a **new or changed** file is read (once, `readFile`) and re-parsed — an unchanged
  corpus costs one `readdir` walk + one `stat` per file, no reads, no parses. A warm revalidation runs in
  the **background** — a bulk change (first refresh after restart, a git checkout) can still mean many
  parses, so a search never blocks on it; results are at most one cycle stale, and the background
  refresh swallows its own errors (an unhandled rejection could crash the in-process host). `indexing` is
  reported whenever any build is in flight (cold OR a background revalidation), so the client's retry loop
  polls until a just-written session lands — read-your-writes without blocking the search. Matching:
  case-insensitive substring AND over whitespace terms (query length + result `limit` clamped to the
  protocol caps, `MAX_HISTORY_QUERY_LENGTH`/`MAX_HISTORY_LIMIT`, at both the handler and `search()`);
  strict recency order; prompts deduped by normalized text keeping newest; caps + true totals.
  The messages section (and `messageTotal`) is filtered to `role === "assistant"` only — a user-role hit
  is always a textual duplicate of its own prompt entry (user text IS a prompt in this extraction), so it
  would add no text, only a location; that location moves onto the prompt hit instead, via the two
  fields below.
- Jump anchors are drift-tolerant: hits carry `anchorText` (message-text prefix) the client validates.
  Every prompt hit now also carries its kept-newest occurrence's `messageIndex`/`anchorText` —
  the same two fields `MessageHit` always had — making the prompt row itself jumpable. Both fields are
  optional on `PromptHit` (absent only when the host predates this feature).
- `testFixtures.ts` — test-only session-file builders (pinned by A5): `writeFixtureSession` writes a
  minimal but real pi-shaped JSONL, one flat file per session, that `historyIndex` tests, the e2e fixture
  seeder, and its own format-pinning test (`testFixtures.test.ts`) drive against; `defaultSessionDirFor`
  replicates pi's private default-layout directory encoding (not importable — see "pi file format" below)
  so fixtures can land where a real no-arg `listAll()` would actually look.

## On-disk JSONL structure (observed from pi session files)
- **`message` entries:** `{ type: "message", ..., message: { role: "user"|"assistant"|"toolResult", content: string|array, timestamp: ms-number } }`
  — `message.role` determines renderability; `message.timestamp` is milliseconds since epoch.
- **`custom_message` entries:** `{ type: "custom_message", customType: string, content: string|array, timestamp: ISO-string, display: boolean, ... }`
  — top-level structure (no `message` wrapper); always renderable as role "custom"; `timestamp` is ISO 8601 string at entry level.

## pi file format (pinned v0.84.3 — `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`)
Verified by reading `dist/core/session-manager.{js,d.ts}` in the installed package (source of truth over
any assumption — re-verify on a pi version bump). These facts now pin **two** consumers: the fixtures
below, and `historyIndex.ts`'s own discovery walk (which must see exactly the files pi's `SessionManager`
would):
- **Header line** (always line 1, `SessionHeader`): `{ type: "session", version?: number, id: string,
  timestamp: string /* ISO */, cwd: string, parentSession?: string }`. `readSessionHeader`/`buildSessionInfo`
  reject the file (return `null`/`[]`) unless the first line parses as JSON with `type === "session"` and a
  string `id`. `CURRENT_SESSION_VERSION = 3`; pi's own writer stamps `version: 3` — fixtures should too, so
  a real `SessionManager` that later opens one never runs migration.
- **File naming:** discovery is driven **purely by the `.jsonl` suffix** — `listSessionsFromDir` does
  `readdir(dir).filter(f => f.endsWith(".jsonl"))`; nothing parses the filename. pi's own writer names new
  files `<isoTimestamp-with-:-and-.-replaced-by-'-'>_<sessionId>.jsonl`, but any `*.jsonl` name works for
  discovery — fixtures don't need to match that exact pattern.
- **`cwd` recovery — and the non-recursive-custom-dir trap:** `cwd` always comes from the header's `cwd`
  field (`header.cwd`), never from directory placement. But *directory structure interacts with discovery*:
  `SessionManager.listAll()` (no args) walks pi's real default root (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/`) **one level of
  directories or symbolic links** — normally one dir per encoded cwd (`getDefaultSessionDirPath`:
  `--<cwd, / and \ and : → '-'>--`) — and flattens the `.jsonl` files found inside each; a symlink whose
  target cannot be read as a directory contributes nothing. But `listAll(sessionDir)` / `list(cwd, sessionDir)`
  — the path taken whenever a **custom** `sessionDir` string is passed (exactly what `HistoryIndex`'s
  constructor and this module's tests do) — calls `listSessionsFromDir(customDir)`, which does a **flat,
  non-recursive** `readdir(customDir)`. Files placed in subdirectories of a custom `sessionDir` are invisible
  to `listAll`. Consequence for fixtures: multi-session, multi-cwd test fixtures must write all `.jsonl`
  files **flat, directly under** the given dir; different `cwd`s are expressed via each file's own header
  `cwd` field, never via subdirectory nesting.
- **Default-layout encoding is not importable — fixtures replicate it (pinned by A5):** the per-cwd
  subdirectory name above is computed by `getDefaultSessionDirPath`, a *private* (unexported) helper inside
  `core/session-manager.js`. The mkdir-ing wrapper that IS exported from that module (`getDefaultSessionDir`)
  is not re-exported from the package root `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` index either (checked
  `dist/index.js`: only `SessionManager` + a handful of pure tree-traversal helpers cross that boundary) —
  so nothing importable computes this path. `testFixtures.ts` exports `defaultSessionDirFor(agentDir, cwd)`,
  a from-scratch replica of the exact regex (`--<cwd, / and \ and : → '-'>--`), pinned in
  `testFixtures.test.ts` against a real `SessionManager.list(cwd)` / `listAll()` call — re-verify against
  `dist/core/session-manager.js` on a pi version bump.
- **`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is read live, not cached (pinned by A5):** `getAgentDir()` (`config.js`) reads
  `process.env.PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` directly in its function body on every call — there is no top-level
  capture at module load. So a same-process test (or the e2e seeder) can set the env var immediately before
  the `SessionManager` call it needs to affect and restore it in a `finally`/`afterAll`; no subprocess is
  needed to observe a "live" env read. (Existing precedent: `agent/agentSessionManager.test.ts` already
  does this for its disk-reopen case.)

## Boundary
- **Public surface (`index.ts`):** `HistoryIndex`, `getHistoryIndex()`, `matchesTerms`, `makeSnippet`,
  `clampLimit`, `extractSession`, types. **No test helpers** — `writeFixtureSession`/`defaultSessionDirFor`
  are disk-writing test-only builders and must not enter the runtime module graph; they're reachable only
  through the server package's dedicated **`@mewa-code/server/history-test-fixtures`** subpath export
  (package.json), the sanctioned test boundary — same pattern as `@mewa-code/server/agent`. In-package
  tests import them relatively (`./testFixtures`); the e2e seeder imports the subpath.
- **Allowed deps:** `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (`getAgentDir` — the default sessions root — plus
  the exported session-tree helpers `parseSessionEntries`/`migrateSessionEntries`/`buildSessionContext`
  used by `extract.ts`; **not `SessionManager`** in production code — see Responsibility. Tests may use
  `SessionManager` to *pin* layout/format facts against the real thing), `@mewa-code/contracts`,
  `node:fs`, `node:fs/promises`, `node:path`.
- **Forbidden:** importing `agent`/`workspaces`/`projects` (scope mapping is injected by the host handler
  via the `filter`/`labels` callbacks passed into `search()`); writing anything to disk (`writeFixtureSession`
  is test-only, never called from production code paths).

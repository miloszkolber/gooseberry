# Colour system

Colour arrives in **two layers**, and a component may only ever name the second one.

```
themes/bundled/*.theme.json    the PALETTE — one file per theme, the only place a hex lives
styles/colors.json             the SEMANTIC layer — what each palette entry is FOR (one file)
styles/colors.schema.json      the editor-facing contract for it
scripts/colors.ts              load / validate / render — the only place a derivation is written
scripts/generate-colors.ts     writes the output; `--check` fails when it is stale
styles/generated/colors.css    GENERATED: the roles, the `@theme inline` map, the effect blocks
themes/runtime.ts              writes the active manifest onto the document root
styles/colorUsage.test.ts      the adoption guard
```

**No colour is written twice.** A role's derivation lives in `colors.json` and nowhere else — not in
`tokens.css` (structure only), not in `index.css` (no `--color-*` at all), not in `runtime.ts` (which
now derives variable names rather than tabulating them). Editing the generated file fails
`bun run colors:check`, which runs in pre-commit and in `apps/web`'s build.

**Variable names are derived, not chosen.** A manifest key writes to its kebab-cased name —
`borderStrong` → `--border-strong`, `editorSelection` → `--editor-selection`. `colors.json` and
`runtime.ts` apply the same rule independently, so a role's `from` and the variable it reads cannot
disagree. There is no lookup table to keep in step, and no more names like `--blue` for `info`.

A **palette entry** answers *which colour* (`--warning`, `--elevated`, `--hint`). A **semantic token**
answers *what for* (`feedback-warning`, `container-elevated-bg`, `text-muted`). Components name roles;
the palette is internal.

```tsx
<div className="bg-container-elevated-bg text-text-muted border-border-default" />  // yes
<div className="bg-[var(--elevated)] text-hint border-border2" />                   // no
```

## Why the split

A theme changes *which* colour a role resolves to without touching a single component, and a role can be
re-pointed once instead of at 160 call sites. It also makes the failure mode visible: `bg-elevated` is
not a Tailwind utility any more, and Tailwind **drops an unknown utility silently** — the element renders
unstyled while its class list claims otherwise. `colorUsage.test.ts` exists because that shipped once.

## The tokens

Declared in `colors.json`, published as utilities by the generator. Every one is used; a token with no
call site is deleted, and so is an alias that can never differ from its neighbour (`border-strong` that
equals `border-default` is not a second weight, it is a second name).

| family | tokens | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `text-default` · `text-muted` · `text-subtle` · `text-disabled` · `text-on-primary` | `text-subtle` (from the `hint` palette key) is the secondary-metadata tier (branch lines, spec role labels); `text-disabled` (the default `text` colour @ 60% — a disabled element inherits its enabled semantic colour, dimmed at the token level) is reserved for genuinely disabled UI text (e.g. the Settings "Soon" item) |
| Container | `container-workspace-bg` · `container-sidebar-bg` · `container-terminal-bg` · `container-header-bg` · `container-content-bg` · `container-elevated-bg` | **The opened-document canvas is `workspace`, not `content`**: the Monaco file editor and the markdown/spec preview sit on the same surface as the chat column and the tab strip, so a document reads as part of the workspace. `content` is the **recessed diff canvas** — the Changes diff, rendered diffs, Shiki code blocks, and the Center Workbench backdrop behind them — which is why Monaco defines two themes (`EDITOR_THEME` = workspace, `THEME` = content). `terminal` is a terminal body + xterm canvas (currently sourced from the same palette key as `sidebar`); `elevated` is every raised surface |
| Control | `control-bg` · `control-bg-hovered` · `control-bg-selected` · `control-primary-bg` · `control-primary-bg-hovered` · `control-primary-text` · `control-border-default` · `control-border-active` · `control-disabled-bg` · `control-disabled-text` · `control-disabled-border` · `control-primary-disabled-bg` · `control-primary-disabled-text` | The three `control-primary-*` tokens are the primary button/control, and they are **per-theme derivations like every other role** — `control-primary-bg` (from `accent`) fill, `control-primary-bg-hovered` (from `accentHover`) hover fill, `control-primary-text` (from `onAccent`) label. `accentHover` is the accent's **hover step**, its own manifest key so a theme owns that step: a primary button hovers to `control-primary-bg-hovered` (a colour token), never `hover:opacity-*`. Because the fill comes from `accent`, `bg-control-primary-bg` and `bg-primary` are the same colour by construction — a primary button can never drift from the theme's accent. `control-bg-hovered` is pointer hover only; `control-bg-selected` is the persistent selected/open/active/highlight fill (currently the same palette source). `control-border-default` is the resting form-control border; `control-border-active` (from `borderStrong`) is the **stronger neutral** border of an *active* control — pressed/`active:` buttons, an open selector (`data-[open=true]`), and a focused text input/textarea. It is the border only: the accent focus **ring** stays as the focus indicator (so accent = focus, neutral-strong = active). Never on inactive/default controls, nor on selected nav rows, tabs, or static surfaces. **Disabled is a first-class control state**, not an opacity utility: **a disabled element inherits the same semantic colour it uses when enabled, resolved at the `strong` (60%) alpha step** — derived at the token level so background, text, icon and border keep explicit ownership and nested content is never dimmed. So the disabled roles are the enabled ones @ 60%: `control-disabled-bg` (from `input`, i.e. `control-bg`), `control-disabled-text` (from `text`, i.e. `text-default`), `control-disabled-border` (from `border`, i.e. `control-border-default`), and the primary pair `control-primary-disabled-bg` (from `accent`, i.e. `control-primary-bg`) + `control-primary-disabled-text` (from `onAccent`, i.e. `control-primary-text`). There are **no** dedicated `disabled` / `primaryDisabled` / `onPrimaryDisabled` palette keys — a disabled state never carries a colour of its own. Text/icon-only controls take just `control-disabled-text`; non-control disabled text stays on `text-disabled`. Do **not** use `disabled:opacity-*` on a component (it dims nested content and bypasses token ownership) |
| Border | `border-default` · `border-muted` | |
| Primary | `primary` + `primary-subtle` · `-soft` · `-muted`, `on-primary-soft` | |
| Feedback | `feedback-{info,success,warning,error}` + the `-subtle` / `-muted` steps in use | a solid border is the solid colour, so there is no `-border` tier |
| Chat bubble | `bubble-user-bg` · `bubble-user-border` | tinted from the manifest's own `bubbleAccent`, which every bundled theme currently ships **equal to its `accent`** — the user bubble wears the brand colour. The separate key is the knob (per `themes/SPEC.md`): a theme that wants the bubble to read as "you" rather than "the product" re-points it without touching a component |
| Effects | `overlay` · `sunken` | written per light/dark by the theme engine |

There is no `text-strong` and no `text-link` utility: they duplicate other tokens, and `--text-link`
exists as a variable for `global.css`'s `a {}` alone.

## Transparency: one form only

**A tint is a token, mixed `in srgb`, on the alpha scale.**

```
subtle 10%   ·   wash 12%   ·   soft 20%   ·   muted 40%   ·   strong 60%
```

`wash` (12%) is the feedback-surface fill step (`feedback-*-subtle`), kept one notch above `subtle`
(10%) so `primary-subtle` and `bubble-user-bg` stay at 10% while feedback backgrounds read at 12%.

Tailwind's `/40` opacity modifier is **not used on colour utilities**. It mixes `in oklab`, so the same
nominal percentage rendered differently depending on whether it came from a class or a token — and the
numbers drifted (10, 12, 15, 16, 25, 30, 35 and 50 were all live at once). A new tint is a new token on
the scale, never a new number in a class name.

## Non-CSS consumers

Monaco, xterm, mermaid and Shiki cannot wear a class; they read the tokens through `getComputedStyle`
and rebuild after the `[data-theme]` swap. They name the same semantic tokens everything else does
(`--container-workspace-bg`, `--container-content-bg`, `--text-muted`, `--editor-selection-bg`), so there
is one name per value. Monaco reads *both* container roles, because which canvas it is painting depends on
the tab: `EDITOR_THEME` (workspace) for a file editor, `THEME` (content) for the Changes diff.
The roles these consumers *share* with components (`--container-*-bg`, `--text-muted`) stay published and
mapped in `@theme inline`; the ones **only** they read (`--editor-selection-bg` / `-text`) are
`publish: false` and unmapped — a utility nothing can use is dead weight. Values reach them canonicalised
to hex via `cssColorToHex` (`lib/utils.ts`), because the built CSS is minified and Monaco/xterm accept
hex only.

**What they do NOT cover, deliberately.** Each of these libraries paints far more than we hand it, and
the remainder comes from its own built-in palette:

| consumer | we set | the rest comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monaco | editor background/foreground, line numbers, cursor, both selection colours, and every syntax rule | `vs` / `vs-dark` / `hc-black` / `hc-light` via `inherit: true` — scrollbars, find/suggest/hover widgets, bracket match, indent guides, overview ruler |
| xterm | background, foreground, cursor, both selection colours, all 16 ANSI | xterm defaults for `cursorAccent` and `selectionInactiveBackground` |
| mermaid | the `themeVariables` map in `chat/tools/visualize/mermaid.ts` | mermaid's `base` theme for anything absent from that map |

This is a bounded, accepted gap, not an oversight. Monaco alone exposes ~200 colour keys; enumerating
them would be a large and brittle surface, and the base is chosen from the manifest's appearance and
contrast metadata, so it is never wildly wrong. If a theme ever looks off in one of these widgets, the
fix is to add that specific key — not to adopt the whole surface.

## Adding or changing a colour

Every case is a JSON edit followed by `bun run colors:generate`.

1. **A theme should look different** → edit `themes/bundled/<theme>.theme.json`. Nothing else changes,
   and no regeneration is needed: manifests are read at runtime.
2. **A role should point somewhere else** → change its `from` in `colors.json`.
3. **A new role** → add it to `roles` with `from`, an optional `alpha` step, and `publish`
   (`true` → a Tailwind utility; `false` → read directly by Monaco/xterm/mermaid/`global.css`).
4. **A new tint** → an `alpha` step from `scale`, never a `/N` at the call site. If the step itself is
   new, add it to `scale` — that is a design decision, and it is made once.
5. **A role two themes must be able to differ on** → it needs its own manifest key. Add it to
   `THEME_COLOR_KEYS` and `theme.schema.json`, and to all six manifests, then point a role at it. The
   generator refuses to run while a role names a key that does not exist, or a key no role reads.

Never: a raw hex or `rgb()` in a component, an inline `style` object, a `bg-[var(--palette-entry)]`
escape hatch, or a second name for a value that already has one.

## What is pinned by tests

`styles/colorUsage.test.ts` fails when:

- a colour utility names a token that `@theme inline` does not publish (the silent-drop bug);
- a component contains a raw hex, `rgb()` or `hsl()`;
- a component reaches a palette entry through `bg-[var(--…)]`;
- a `/N` opacity modifier appears on a colour utility;
- a declared token has no call site, or a published utility has no token;
- the committed generated files do not match what `colors.json` renders.

`themes/schema.test.ts` additionally pins the **contrast floors**, and those deserve stating here
because two of the lines are our judgement rather than the standard's:

- on every RESTING surface (`background`, `content`, `sidebar`, `header`, `elevated`, `input`) text
  meets WCAG AA in full — 4.5 for body and the `text-muted` tier;
- the deliberately quiet `text-subtle` / `hint` tier remains visible at **3.0** on every resting surface;
- on the transient HOVER surface the floor is **3.0**, not 4.5;
- the `hover` fill — the palette source of `control-bg-hovered` / `control-bg-selected` — stays
  **distinguishable from every resting surface**: ≥ **1.15** against all six. No canvas is exempt:
  interactive fills reach each of them (the content canvas hosts PlanPane's rows and the workbench
  backdrop's controls; `input` is the resting fill hovered controls swap away from).

WCAG has no "transient state" allowance, so the hover tier is a line we drew deliberately. These themes
lift the row background toward the text colour on hover, and holding that to 4.5 would have forced a
theme's signature accent toward a washed-out tint just to survive the hovered row. 3.0 keeps hovered
text comfortably visible while leaving the themes recognisable.
Revisit it if strict AA across every state ever becomes a requirement.

The distinguishability floor is equally ours: WCAG has no adjacent-fill metric at all. It exists
because High Contrast Light shipped `hover` at 1.05:1 against its own sidebar — selected
project/workspace rows were indistinguishable from the panel — while every legibility check stayed
green; review of that fix then found Light shipping `hover == content` outright, so PlanPane's
hovered rows vanished the same way. 1.15 is the line that separates a visible fill from an invisible
one; every bundled theme clears it on all six surfaces (the weakest live pair is Light's
hover-on-content at 1.165).

`themes/runtime.test.ts` pins application; `themes/shiki.test.ts` pins the syntax-variable map. See [`themes/SPEC.md`](../themes/SPEC.md) for the manifest itself and
[TYPOGRAPHY.md](./TYPOGRAPHY.md) for the parallel type system.

## Scope: this app only

`apps/website` — the public landing page — has its own stylesheet with its own hardcoded colours and
fonts, and shares nothing with this system. That is deliberate: it is a static marketing page on GitHub
Pages with no theme switching, no runtime, and no reason to carry a token layer. Do not "fix" it by
importing from here; if it ever needs to match the app, the move is to extract a small shared token
package, not to reach across apps.

# Mewa Code Blog Author Guide

This guide documents how to write and publish blog posts for the Mewa Code website.

## Post Structure

Each post lives in its own directory under `content/blog/`:

```
content/blog/
└── YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug/
    ├── index.md          # The post content
    └── images/           # Optional: local images
        ├── screenshot.png
        └── diagram.svg
```

The directory name should follow the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-slug` for sorting, though the
actual publish date and URL slug come from frontmatter.

## Frontmatter Schema

Every post requires YAML frontmatter at the top of `index.md`:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"        # Required: displayed as H1 and in browser tab
slug: post-url-slug             # Required: becomes /blog/post-url-slug/
date: 2026-01-15                # Required: YYYY-MM-DD format (UTC)
excerpt: "A brief summary..."   # Optional: shown on blog index cards and as the page description
draft: true                     # Optional: if true, post is skipped in production builds
tags:                           # Optional: displayed on post and index cards
  - announcement
  - feature
---
```

The schema is validated at build time (`src/content.config.ts`): a missing required field, a
malformed slug, a reserved slug (`rss`, `images`, …), or two posts sharing one slug **fail the
build** — broken posts cannot reach production.

### Field Details

| Field     | Required | Description                                              |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`   | Yes      | Post title (don't repeat as H1 in body — it's rendered from frontmatter) |
| `slug`    | Yes      | URL slug (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces); becomes the permanent `/blog/<slug>/` URL |
| `date`    | Yes      | Publish date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (interpreted as UTC) |
| `excerpt` | No       | 1-2 sentence summary for index cards, SEO description, and the RSS feed |
| `draft`   | No       | Set `true` to exclude from production builds (still visible in `bun run dev`) |
| `tags`    | No       | Array of lowercase tags for categorization               |

## Markdown Features

Standard Markdown is fully supported, plus:

### Syntax Highlighting

Fenced code blocks with language hints get syntax highlighting (Shiki, via Astro), with dual
light/dark themes that follow the site's theme toggle:

````markdown
```typescript
const greeting: string = "Hello, Mewa Code!";
console.log(greeting);
```
````

### Local Images

Place images in an `images/` subdirectory and reference them with relative paths:

```markdown
![Screenshot of the settings panel](./images/settings.png)
```

Astro resolves, optimizes, and fingerprints them automatically during build.

### YouTube Videos

Embed YouTube videos using the `<iframe>` tag:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Use the `youtube-nocookie.com` domain — the static site does not permit cookie-setting embeds. The build enforces this: plain `youtube.com/embed` URLs
are rewritten to the nocookie domain, and a `title` + `loading="lazy"` are added when omitted
(`src/youTubeEmbeds.ts`).

## Best Practices

1. **Don't duplicate the title**: The frontmatter `title` is rendered as the H1. Start the body
   below it — don't open with `# Same Title`.

2. **Use descriptive slugs**: The slug becomes the permanent URL. Choose something readable
   and SEO-friendly: `introducing-mewa-code` not `post-1`.

3. **Write an excerpt**: The excerpt appears on index cards, in the page's meta description,
   and in the RSS feed. Without one, visitors only see the title and date.

4. **Use draft mode**: Set `draft: true` while writing. Drafts render in the local dev server
   but are excluded from production builds.

5. **Optimize images**: Compress PNGs/JPGs before committing. Large images slow page loads.

6. **Preview locally**: Run `bun run dev` in `apps/website/` — the blog is served at
   `http://localhost:4321/blog/` with hot reload as you edit. `bun run build && bun run preview`
   shows the exact production output (drafts excluded).

## Build Process

The blog is part of the site's Astro build (`astro build`):

1. `content/blog/*/index.md` files load as a typed content collection (`src/content.config.ts`)
2. Frontmatter is validated against the schema — invalid posts fail the build
3. Markdown renders with Shiki dual-theme highlighting and the YouTube embed transform
4. Pages generate at `/blog/` (index) and `/blog/<slug>/` (posts), plus an RSS feed at
   `/blog/rss.xml`
5. Post images are optimized and emitted with hashed filenames

## Deployment

Deployment is intentionally deferred while Mewa Code is a source foundation. Preview posts locally and do not publish announcement or installation content until real release channels exist.

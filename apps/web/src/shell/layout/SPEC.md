## Responsibility

The shell-owned, headless workbench engine: legal layout mutations, recursive center/side rendering,
resize and drag geometry, keyboard arrangement commands, and focus recovery for the host-synchronized
`WorkspaceLayoutDocument`. It renders containers; feature views remain arrangement-agnostic.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** the pure topology/policy operations; semantic minimum and group-limit checks; one-result drag
  previews; center split and side-stack renderers; tab-strip overflow; ARIA tab/separator behavior; and the
  visibility gate that mounts a terminal body only while that terminal is selected in a visible group.
- **Public surface (`index.ts`):** the workbench renderer/controller, pure document mutations and invariant
  validator, built-in preset definitions + instantiate/refill operations, attention-fallback helpers, and
  their web-only types. Callers pass resource/tool render callbacks rather
  than importing feature views here.
- **External deps:** `@mewa-code/contracts` (layout/resource types), shell-neutral `lib` attention/id
  primitives, React, `react-resizable-panels`, `@dnd-kit/core`.
- **Forbidden:** server/shared/pi imports; owning domain-resource lifetime; direct persistence or WS calls;
  importing panel internals; a mutable third-party docking model; inline component styles or non-semantic
  colour values.

## State contract

The parent shell is the integration boundary: it supplies accepted store state, device-local attention,
commit/error callbacks, current layout settings, and feature renderers. Every structural operation is a pure
`WorkspaceLayoutDocument → result | unavailable-reason` transaction. A successful discrete command emits
one complete document; components never splice the store's group/tab arrays.

The shared document carries topology, stable group/split ids, tab membership/order, per-center-group preview
identity, side visibility/folds, restore targets, and normalized geometry. A click that may still become a
browser `dblclick` waits one shared 250 ms settle window; the upgraded gesture emits only its final keep while
retaining the leading preview-slot claim, whether content was already cached or required a host read. It never carries selected tabs,
focus, navigation clocks, pointer drafts, or viewport compression. The browser-local attention overlay keeps
selection per group plus last focus for center/each side and a zero-initialized clock for every center leaf;
structural replacement reconciles it to the nearest surviving identity and prunes removed-leaf clocks without
publishing.

## Layout grammar

- **Center:** a recursive horizontal/vertical binary tree, maximum four leaves. A split replaces one leaf
  with equal halves. User creation/resize requires each child to remain at least 320 px wide and 180 px high.
  Losing a leaf's final tab removes that leaf and promotes its sibling; one final empty leaf always remains.
- **Sides:** left/right are ordered vertical stacks. Projects, Specs, All files, Changes, and Review are
  singleton side-only tools; terminals alone may cross between center and sides. Dragging an outer side
  separator through its minimum hides that side through the same shared visibility transaction as its
  keyboard/menu command, retains the last expanded width, and exposes the hidden-side restore rail. During a
  compatible tab drag, every side group exposes broad upper/lower targets below its tab strip; they create a
  group immediately before/after that group, including at interior boundaries. Folded rows divide their
  compact height between the same two targets. Empty groups disappear, and an empty side auto-hides. Expanded bodies have a 120 px
  normal minimum; independently folded groups occupy 27 px and retain their normalized expanded weights.
  Closing a singleton keeps its local feature state and restore target; a View/deep-link reveal restores or
  unfolds it in place and focuses the requested item.
- **Limits:** the host setting defaults to six groups per side. Existing overages survive; creation is
  unavailable until the side falls below its limit. Reorder/join/reducing moves remain legal. Center and side
  domain eligibility, stable-id uniqueness, one canonical placement per resource, and the final-center-leaf
  invariant are enforced by every mutation.
- **Small viewports:** restoring onto less space may compress below operation minimums locally. Content
  scrolls/clips; the shared topology and ratios are never rewritten merely because this viewport is narrow.

Ordinary opens target this browser's last-focused surviving center group. Reopening a canonical resource
selects its existing placement instead of duplicating it and refreshes non-identity metadata such as a chat
label in place. Each center group has one preview slot: preview
replaces in place, keep promotes one-way, and navigation clocks are group-local. A passive automatic restore
may select its first result without incrementing that user-navigation clock. A user open advances its clock
at request time and carries that stamp through acceptance instead of counting again; explicitly clicking or
choosing the already-selected center tab also advances once, because that deliberate re-selection must beat
older deferred work. Incidental/programmatic DOM focus capture only updates last-focus routing and is
count-neutral, preventing a Group Header click or focus-restoration request from counting twice. An async completion
reroutes from a removed destination to current last focus (advancing that surviving destination once), unless
a newer shared snapshot already placed the resource. A user close advances attention and compatibility
navigation exactly once only after structural acceptance (or after an authoritative terminal close); a
rejected layout write leaves the resource, focus, and navigation clocks untouched. The overtaken test
compares the workspace's center-navigation tick captured at close request against acceptance time —
navigation the attention clocks cannot see (an incoming Back/Forward route bumps the tick at adoption,
before its authoritative read) still makes the acceptance count as overtaken instead of cancelling it. Delayed terminal close
settlement resolves the resource semantically against the latest document, so a move is followed while an
unrelated resource that reused the old opaque placement id is never closed. Any newer tab gesture or center
navigation suppresses delayed close-focus recovery; structural reconciliation that removes the closing group's
clock does not impersonate such navigation, so collapsing the final tab in a leaf still restores visible tab focus.

## Arrangement and accessibility

A tab drag paints exactly one result: strip insertion, whole-group join, legal center half-split, or a side
group's broad upper/lower before-or-after target. An expanded side tab strip remains the join/reorder target
while its content halves create groups; a folded row has no content, so its compact upper/lower halves become
the creation targets during a drag. The user never has to acquire a thin outer edge. A hidden side exposes
its full-height rail as a creation target only when the tab is side-compatible and the group limit permits it.
Illegal domains, limits, exact-position no-ops, or minimums paint no valid target and commit nothing. Escape,
pointer cancellation, outside drop, or a superseding remote revision restores the source. Drag moves one tab
only—never copies, crosses workspaces, or moves a whole group.

Pointer is never the sole arrangement path. Keyboard controls and the shadcn menu surface cover group/tab
focus, select/close/keep/reorder/move, directional splits, absolute and adjacent side-group creation, side
fold/show/hide/tool restore, and keyboard separator resize, always with an unavailable reason. A tab can
reproduce any interior pointer placement by moving into the destination group and invoking New group above
or New group below. Tab strips implement the WAI-ARIA tabs pattern and
visible roving focus; a folded side group retains its linked native-hidden tabpanel while unmounting the body,
and separators expose orientation and current/min/max values. One-row strips have bounded
readable tab widths, wheel/trackpad scrolling, previous/next controls, active reveal, and a searchable
keyboard overflow list.

## Presets and synchronization

Balanced, Focus, and Review are web-owned portable definitions; custom presets use the same resource-free
shape. Instantiation fills resources deterministically, prunes unused center leaves, and never imports a
foreign workspace identity. Selecting, applying, or first-seeding a preset raises the synchronized side-group
limit first when its topology requires more groups; an existing over-limit document otherwise remains
grandfathered. Applying a preset preserves resources by flattening center tabs in visual order,
seeding one per leaf, putting the remainder in the primary leaf, and relocating side terminals through the
same-side → opposite-side → primary-center fallback without overriding the preset's side visibility.
Existing singleton-tool placement ids survive relocation, and a newly materialized tool receives a fresh
placement-only id when its conventional id is already owned by another semantic resource. Singleton tools
omitted by a custom preset stay deliberately unplaced but receive default/prior-side restore
targets, so an empty portable preset can never strand the user without a Projects/tool recovery path.

Pointer drag/resize drafts remain local and emit one snapshot only on drop/pointer-up. A newer accepted
revision whose mutation id does not match this client's optimistic base cancels the draft, makes release
inert, and lets the parent explain the cancellation; the same projection epoch invalidates a pending
preview-click settle timer before it can publish from the replaced document. A matching acknowledgement
advances the accepted revision without cancelling a newer draft begun on that document. The parent
`layoutSync` module supplies exact-base optimistic concurrency: a stale replacement conflict installs host
current state and advances the same projection epoch, while this pure module remains unaware of transport,
persistence, and optimistic queues.

The terminal visibility gate mounts a body only for a terminal locally selected in an expanded visible group.
Several distinct terminal identities may mount concurrently; the same identity has one body per browser, and
inactive/folded/hidden terminal tabs never attach. Every center Group Header retains a New terminal command;
it captures that group in the placement intent, so closing the final terminal body cannot remove the creation
path and a vanished captured group reroutes to current center focus.

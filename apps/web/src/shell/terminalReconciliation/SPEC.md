## Responsibility

Reconcile the host-authoritative terminal catalog with shared layout references while keeping PTY lifetime
and browser-local attention separate from placement.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** authoritative-catalog advancement tracking; pruning placements only after catalog readiness;
  passive restoration of confirmed domain tabs; title refresh; placement of pre-layout/recovered terminals;
  and deferring catalog completion until any resulting optimistic layout projection settles.
- **Public surface (`index.ts`):** the mounted terminal placement/catalog reconciliation hook and terminal
  placement-id helper used by intent processing.
- **External deps:** contracts terminal/layout types; store terminal catalog state; the panel-owned terminal
  catalog hydration hook; React.
- **Forbidden:** creating/attaching/closing PTYs, controlling terminal stream ownership, selecting a remotely
  restored terminal, direct WS calls, panel rendering, server/shared/pi imports, or treating layout references
  as terminal existence proof.

New attach-pending terminals continue through their explicit placement intents. Remote/catalog restoration
preserves side visibility and never steals attention.

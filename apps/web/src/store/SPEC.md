## Responsibility

The single Zustand store: connection status, projects/workspaces, accepted host-synchronized workbench
snapshots plus device-local attention, terminal catalogs, and one **per-session chat runtime** for every live
`AgentSession` (so several chats stream concurrently).

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `appStore.ts` — connection/projects/workspaces state + setters. Connection state has two
  monotonic edges with different meanings: `setStatus("connected")` advances **`connectionGeneration`**
  for reconnect hydration, while **`welcomeGeneration`** advances only when one complete
  `server.welcome` snapshot lands. **`installWelcomeSnapshot(protocolVersion, projects, recentProjects,
  config?)`** installs protocol + both sorted project views + optional config + navigation repair and then
  advances that readiness edge in one Zustand write; route validation never observes a protocol-only or
  project-only intermediate state. `installProjectSnapshot` remains the project-only primitive for focused
  callers. **`projects`** is the open rail, while **`recentProjects`** is the last-opened-ordered set of every
  known open + closed project. **`applyProjectUpdated(project)`** is the one full-snapshot updater for
  `project.updated` pushes and authoritative project-mutation responses: it upserts/sorts Recents and either
  upserts/sorts the rail or removes the row when `closed === true`. Both actions reconcile stale navigation
  too: only when this client's selected project or active workspace belongs to a record no longer open,
  they clear the active workspace and select the first remaining project's Home (or `null` when none
  remain), while deliberately retaining every workspace layout/attention/resource-render/terminal/session
  map for lossless reopen. Other-client opens never steal navigation, and a background close never moves it.
  All project response call sites use the same updater, so the open and recent copies cannot drift.
  Explicit local transitions are **`selectMain()`**, **`selectProject(projectId, opts?)`**, and
  **`activateWorkspace(workspace)`**; each updates its coupled scope ids atomically, and there is no generic
  active-workspace setter that can split the invariant. **`expandedProjectIds: Record<string, true>`** is the
  Projects rail's per-browser expansion — store-held (it must survive the rail's remounts and be writable by
  non-rail gestures) with **`toggleProjectExpanded(projectId)`** (the chevron), **`expandProject(projectId)`**
  (idempotent reveal: workspace creation / worktree attach / the active-workspace visibility rule), and
  `selectProject`'s **`{ reveal: true }`** option — the user-gesture variant that enters a project's home and
  expands its row in one write (rail row click, Welcome-screen open adoption); navigation restore and the
  workspace-removal fallback call it bare, staying expansion-neutral. Project-snapshot installs prune
  expansion to the open rail (a closed project's entry drops; identity-stable when unchanged).
  **`hydrateExpandedProjects(projectIds)`** seeds the set at boot from the `panels/projectExpansion`
  persistence module — the store itself still touches no storage: that module owns the localStorage
  mirror (host-qualified key, best-effort writes, untrusted reads) and subscribes to changes. Validated route restoration uses
  **`activateWorkspaceFromRoute(workspace, sessionId?)`**: it applies the same scope ids, advances the
  compatibility workspace navigation tick plus the current destination-group clock, and either installs a
  transient **`routeChatTarget`** stamped with both clocks or clears an older exact target. A workspace-only
  route carries no center-tab intent, so it retains existing browser-local attention; ordinary location
  derivation may then canonicalize it to an already-selected chat. **`routeChatTargetGeneration`** advances
  only on target installation (including same-workspace deep links), so consumption cannot duplicate the
  shell reconciliation pass. `selectCurrentRouteChatTarget` is the one check that the target's workspace and
  navigation stamp still hold. The shell's chat-reconciliation module validates/hydrates that target before
  passive auto-open; a successful authoritative absence consumes it, while failures retain it for reconnect.
  The store owns no URL/history/storage access — `navigation` owns serialization and drivers. It also owns
  the **workspace lifecycle reactions** every client runs
  identically on the `workspace.created`/`updated`/`removed` pushes (no per-client optimism — the backend
  is authoritative): **`addWorkspace(ws)`** upserts a
  `workspace.created` snapshot by `id` (no-op if the project isn't listed yet — reconciles on its next
  `workspace.list` rather than seeding a partial one-row list; else add-if-absent / merge-if-present,
  idempotent with the creating client's own post-create re-list); **`updateWorkspace(ws)`** folds a
  `workspace.updated` snapshot in: **replace** the record by `id` in `workspaces[ws.projectId]`, carrying
  over only the list-computed `diffStats` aggregate (the snapshot is the persisted record, which has none).
  The push is authoritative, so a *replace* — never a merge: a merge could not clear an **optional field the
  host dropped** (`diffBase` re-pointed back to the creation base, the last `skillOverrides` entry removed),
  leaving the client labelling and keying reads off a value the host no longer has; a project never fetched or an id absent from its list is a **no-op** — the next
  `workspace.list` reconciles; **`applyWorkspaceRemoved(projectId, id)`** is the **entire** removal
  reaction (`removeWorkspace` drops the row + `clearWorkspaceState` drops its
  layout/attention/terminal maps and chat runtimes,
  and **if it was this client's active workspace** → `selectProject(projectId)` (shell falls back to its
  owning Project Home) + a neutral toast that reads right for both the initiator and an observer); the
  primitive **`removeWorkspace(projectId, id)`** just drops the row (unknown project/id is a no-op);
  **workspace layout state** — `layoutSnapshotsByWorkspace` holds the latest accepted
  `WorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` for each workspace; `installLayoutSnapshot` is a revision-aware whole-value
  replacement (older/duplicate revisions are inert), while one atomic optimistic-commit action installs the
  shell integration's next complete document and appends a pending write carrying both its correlation
  `mutationId` and captured `expectedRevision`. The first write expects the accepted revision (or `null` for
  absence); each dependent write expects the revision its predecessor will produce. The browser sends those
  full snapshots to `layout.replace` serially per workspace while projecting all of them immediately; if one
  write rejects or conflicts, dependent later projections are rolled back before they ever reach the host, so
  a queued snapshot cannot resurrect the rejected base. Accepted state and the latest optimistic projection
  remain distinct, so an acknowledgement removes its matching pending entry without rolling back a newer
  projection. Correlation settlement is independent of revision installation: even an acknowledgement whose
  snapshot is already older than the accepted base clears its mutation id without reinstalling that document.
  If that matching broadcast settles optimism but its request response is then lost, the accepted snapshot is
  still success—no false rollback or save error. A nonmatching accepted write advances the canonical base; it
  does not rewrite captured expectations or erase optimistic snapshots still awaiting host order. A typed
  conflict installs the returned current snapshot (including authoritative absence), cancels the conflicting
  mutation and every dependent projection, and advances the projection epoch; if a newer accepted broadcast
  overtook the response in transit, the revision-aware fold preserves that newer authority instead of
  regressing to the conflict-time snapshot or absence. A conflict is expected synchronization, not a generic
  save failure, and never triggers an automatic stale-document resend.
  Components never splice group/tab arrays independently. Installing an accepted document also reconciles
  browser-local resource projections without changing attention: a peer-restored chat placement immediately
  restores its render-cache identity/label and removes duplicate closed-history membership, then hydrates its
  runtime in the background if needed; a removed-but-live chat enters history
  while its runtime
  remains; tombstoned or authoritatively absent references queue structural cleanup instead of hydrating.
  An empty pre-hydration cache never counts as absence: each resource catalog/read must be current for the
  connection generation before it can trigger pruning. Any rejected write drops dependent optimism,
  restores the latest accepted snapshot, advances the projection epoch (remounting uncontrolled resize
  geometry and cancelling any newer draft based on the rejected projection), and surfaces only unexpected
  failures through the generic save-error path.
  `clearWorkspaceTabs` removes the snapshot and all associated local state when the workspace itself
  disappears. A page-lifetime `removedWorkspaceIds` tombstone then rejects stale layout, catalog, session,
  cache, and workspace-list arrivals, so an already-in-flight read cannot recreate the removed workspace.

  **Browser-local resource render state** is keyed by workspace + canonical resource id, never embedded in
  the shared layout reference: loaded file/diff content and ticks, editor view modes, live chat runtimes, and
  any resolved legacy-document markdown stay local caches over their domain sources. Shared placement ids stay
  stable, but a placement id that is already owned by another semantic browser cache falls back to a distinct
  collision-safe cache id; hydration must never overwrite that other resource's metadata. A virtual document is
  legal only when its shared reference names a registered resolver plus durable source identity; `todo-plan`
  resolves by session to the live `PlanPane` over the host-owned TODO plan. Arbitrary inline markdown cannot
  enter the layout.

  **Device-local layout attention** is separate: selected tab per stable group, last-focused center group,
  last-focused group per side, and per-group navigation clocks keyed by host/workspace. Selection/focus
  mutations never alter or publish
  the shared document. Installing a structural snapshot reconciles attention deterministically to the nearest
  surviving tab/group. Navigation clocks advance at request time for every local focus-changing open and
  for an explicit re-selection of the already-active center tab (that click still supersedes older work); that
  stamp travels with the layout intent, so accepting the resulting open/select never increments the same
  group a second time. If structural reconciliation removed the stamped group, the completion reroutes and
  advances its surviving destination exactly once. A slow preview completion is discarded if a newer
  navigation overtook it. Preview identity itself is structural
  and shared per center group; `preview` replaces only that group's slot, while `keep` promotes it one-way.
  A coalesced preview→keep gesture carries `claimPreview` on its single final open intent so the kept tab
  replaces that slot without publishing an intermediate structural snapshot.
  Arrangement-agnostic open intents enter the store, but only the shell layout integration resolves them
  against local last focus and commits placement. `syncLegacySelection` mirrors the selected workbench
  resource into the temporary file/chat/terminal render-cache projection without incrementing navigation,
  atomically clearing the incompatible editor/terminal mirror (and clearing both while the selected resource
  has no cache yet); its reactive selector returns the matched cache/catalog key (not only a readiness
  boolean), so replacing a canonical cache id with a stable shared placement id retriggers the mirror.
  this keeps migration-era feature selectors coherent after initial or remote hydration without making cache
  state a second placement authority. Reopening an existing canonical resource changes attention
  only unless its non-identity metadata changed; for example, pi's `setTitle` updates a queued open in place
  (retargeting a cache alias to the stable placement id when needed) or emits a non-activating refresh for an
  actually placed chat. A structurally accepted close is never undone
  by a late title event; that event instead repairs the retained cache/history label without stealing focus.

  **`terminalsByWorkspace` remains a mirror of terminal domain state, never placement authority.** The host
  owns terminal existence and keys shells by `(workspaceId, tabKey)`; the layout snapshot merely references a
  tab key at one eligible location. `setWorkspaceTerminals` adopts `terminal.list` / `terminal.tabs`, retaining
  an omitted local tab only while its own attach is genuinely in flight. `addTerminal` mints a durable key
  and may attach a captured center-group destination to its placement intent (it never edits topology itself),
  so Group Header creation still works with no terminal body mounted; attach registers the key host-side and
  consumes any initial command only for a newly created shell. Confirmed
  close removes the domain tab and queues a resource-removal intent; the shell layout integration prunes
  every stale placement through the next whole-document commit. A stale layout reference never reattaches or
  recreates an absent catalog entry. There is no workspace-global
  `activeTerminal`: each browser's selected tab per group decides which terminal body mounts, while the host's
  existing exclusive attach/takeover contract decides which client controls a given PTY. The
  **per-session chat state** — `sessions: Record<sessionId, SessionRuntime>`, where a `SessionRuntime` holds
  one chat's `turns` (pi-canonical) / `toolResults` / `askAnswers` (the `ask-user-answers` replies keyed
  by tool call id — indexed by the reducer and hydration, never turned into bubbles) /
  `currentAssistantId` / `attemptAssistantId` (scopes overflow removal to the attempt actually observed) /
  `isStreaming` / `model` /
  `thinkingLevel` / `stats` / `commands` / `draft` and its **extension-UI state** (`pendingExtUi` (typed by
  `chat`'s `ExtUiDialogRequest`) + `extUiQueue` (overlapping dialogs FIFO so none orphans its server
  promise) + `extUiStatus` / `extUiWidget`). `openChatSession` creates a runtime; `closeChatRuntime` /
  `clearWorkspaceState` drop it; per-session mutators (`appendUserMessage` / **`appendErrorTurn`** / `setStats` / `setCommands` /
  `setCurrentModel` / `setThinkingLevel` / `setChatDraft` / `clearPendingExtUi`) take a `sessionId`.
  **`appendErrorTurn(sessionId, text)`** appends an `error` turn for a **rejected** turn-driving wire call
  (`session.prompt`/`steer`/`followUp`/`create`) — e.g. `prompt()` throwing "no API key" / a bad model —
  so a failed send lands in the chat instead of being swallowed; a *streaming* fault instead ends the run
  through **`reduceSessionEvent`** at `agent_settled`, using the host-projected final terminal metadata:
  `stopReason: "error"` carries Pi's `errorMessage`, and `stopReason: "length"` becomes an actionable
  truncation error — neither may become "✓ Done". `agent_end` is attempt-level and never clears
  `isStreaming`; settlement alone finishes retries, compaction, and queued continuations. The
  **compaction lifecycle is a first-class turn**: `compaction_start` appends a `compaction` turn
  (`running`), `compaction_end` settles the trailing running one in place (success → `done` +
  tokens-before/after from the typed `CompactionEndResult`, guarded — wire data is untrusted; `aborted`
  → `cancelled`; `errorMessage` → `failed` carrying the message, e.g. pi's one-shot overflow-recovery
  cap — a failed compaction must be visible, never swallowed) or appends the settled turn when no
  running one exists (reconnect mid-compaction). A successful `compaction_end` with `willRetry: true`
  additionally marks the turn `resuming` (pi continues the same run; settlement clears the flag — a
  settled transcript never claims ongoing work) and still removes the superseded assistant attempt. The
  reducer relies on pi's guarantee that every emitted `compaction_start` is paired with a
  `compaction_end` (both success and failure paths emit it), the same trust every other event pair gets.
  **`auto_retry_start` mirrors pi's live-context surgery**: pi's `_prepareRetry` trims the failed
  attempt's assistant message from the live context before re-running the turn (the retry re-streams it
  as a new message) while *keeping it in the session file*, so the reducer drops the superseded failed
  assistant turn (`removeSupersededAssistant`, the same rule as the overflow-compaction path) —
  otherwise the client renders the reply twice (frozen failed partial + retried copy). Hydration applies
  the same presentation rule to the persisted copy (`chat/hydrate.ts` hides retried attempts — an
  errored assistant followed by another assistant before any user message), so live and reloaded clients
  agree. Closed
  chats are reopenable: the workbench close command first publishes the shared placement removal and only
  after host acceptance invokes **`closeChatToHistory`**, which **keeps the runtime + session alive** and
  records it in **`closedChatsByWorkspace`** (`ClosedChat[]`, per workspace, most-recent-first) and clears
  any pending jump/history-open request for that session — but **never a `routeChatTarget`**: the close
  acceptance is a delayed echo of an older click, while a route target may have been installed by a newer
  Back/Forward to that very chat; target lifecycle belongs to navigation supersession (`navTick` currency)
  and reconciliation consumption/absence, not to tab closure. File, diff, and registered-document render caches
  follow the same acceptance-before-removal order; once no layout
  write is pending, the shell reclaims only caches absent from both accepted placement and queued opens,
  without advancing user-navigation clocks. A newer remote restoration keeps or rehydrates them instead of
  losing the placement. **`reopenChat(workspaceId, …)`** restores
  runtime/history membership in its captured workspace even after another workspace becomes active; the shell layout integration adds
  placement to the locally chosen center group through the one structural commit path. **`noteClosedChats`** records
  disk-only sessions (from `session.list`) there too — idempotently (skips live/open/already-listed) — so a
  chat that survived a host restart is reopenable. **`deleteChat(workspaceId, sessionId)`** is the idempotent
  fold for both a confirmed local `session.delete` and the `session.deleted` broadcast: it atomically drops
  every tab the chat owns — its transcript, live plan page, and any dependent legacy document cache — plus
  its history row/runtime + skill baseline, records a page-lifetime tombstone, removes queued opens for the
  chat or its dependent documents, and queues a resource-removal intent. The shell layout integration
  removes every matching chat placement and session-backed plan reference through its pure mutation path,
  then reconciles local attention before publishing the complete document. Until then the tombstone renders
  no body, so a stale shared reference cannot recreate or hydrate the session. **`noteClosedChats`** and
  **`hydrateSession`** reject tombstoned session ids, so
  stale `session.list` / `session.getMessages` results already in flight cannot recreate a deleted chat;
  the tombstone survives workspace teardown because an older read can still settle afterward. The
  active-workspace hydration pass snapshots **`selectWorkspaceSessionIds`** before each `session.list`; when
  that authoritative read lands, **`reconcileWorkspaceSessions`** applies the same tombstone fold to every
  baseline id absent from the host result, repairing deletion events missed while disconnected without
  deleting a session created after the read began or advancing a user-navigation clock. Otherwise
  **`hydrateSession`** rebuilds browser-local
  runtime/render state from a host `SessionSummary` + converted transcript on connect; placement comes only
  from the accepted layout, the bounded live/unfinished auto-open policy, or an explicit reopen commit — the
  live summary's `lastSettlement` is authoritative when present; otherwise only a failure on
  the persisted transcript's final conversational message is current (historical `length` attempts followed
  by later work must not become stale warnings). Hydration is a no-op if a runtime already exists, so a
  live/ahead chat is never clobbered. The
  pure **`reduceSessionEvent`** folds a `PiEvent` into a runtime. **Only idle sends enter the transcript
  optimistically** (`ChatView.onSubmit` → `appendUserMessage`); the last-turn echo dedup below is
  sufficient precisely because nothing intervenes before the echo. A **streaming send (`steer`/`followUp`)
  never appends a turn**: its text lives in `queue` (folded verbatim from pi's `queue_update`, seeded from
  the summary's snapshot at hydration) and the turn lands only via pi's canonical user `message_start` —
  at its true position, converging live with hydrated. (Mirrors pi's own interactive mode; replaces the
  optimistic-append-for-everything model whose last-turn dedup missed whenever assistant content landed
  between the append and the echo — reproduced live as a duplicated, mispositioned queued bubble.)
  For the idle echo: an equal Pi `message_start` echo is ignored, while Pi's canonical expanded `<skill>`
  echo **replaces** the immediately preceding matching raw `/skill:<name> …` turn in place (same turn id),
  so live and hydrated transcripts both contain one canonical skill invocation; a malformed or mismatched
  block appends normally. **`handlePiEvent(event,
  sessionId)`** and **`applyExtUi(request)`** route by id via the `withRuntime` helper (a no-op for an
  unknown session). The host-wide **`models`** list stays global (not per session), plus
  **`modelsRefreshing`** — the awaited `model.refresh` in-flight flag — and **`modelsFresh`**, the
  *provenance* of that list: true only while it holds the installed result of an awaited forced refresh,
  which `NewWorkspaceDialog` needs before it may substitute a model the catalog lacks. It lives here,
  beside the list, precisely **because `models` is app-wide**: `setModelsForProviderVersion` (a guarded
  `model.list` snapshot, whose handler answers from before the detached refresh it starts) **drops** it in the same write, so authority
  falls with the list any consumer replaced — held as one consumer's local flag it would outlive its
  subject and confirm a removed model that `create()` then rejects. `beginModelsRefresh` captures and
  returns the current provider version; `finishModelsRefresh(version, RefreshedModels|null)` lands only a
  matching reply (list + provenance + cleared in-flight flag in one write; `null` = failed refresh — keep
  the current list *and* its
  provenance, since nothing was installed). Provenance comes from the **host's** `complete`, never from
  "a reply arrived": the host caps how long it waits for pi, so a reply can carry the registry as it
  stands while the pass that would settle it still runs — such a list is installed (it *is* current) but
  drops authority, since concluding a model is gone from it is exactly the mistake. **`dropModelsFreshness`** is the third writer: authority is
  given up *without* replacing the list, which is what a consumer activating must do **synchronously** —
  a flag an earlier consumer set can otherwise straddle the activation and let an inherited list pass as
  this opening's own truth before its own `model.list` reply lands. **`providerVersion`** is the monotonic,
  data-free `provider.changed` generation observed from the host; **`noteProviderChanged()`** atomically
  increments it and clears `models`, freshness, and any old refresh spinner. Both `model.list` and
  `model.refresh` replies install through version-guarded store actions, so no picker or older async reply can
  offer a removed runtime generation. Transport owns the guarded re-read; the Providers settings pane observes
  the version and re-reads status. Other catalog transport work lives in `chat/useModelCatalog`, not here (the
  store→transport edge stays type-only). The **in-app login** state
  **`activeLogin: LoginState | null`** (type from `auth`) is **flat + session-less** (a login runs on the
  Welcome screen before any session exists — routing it through a session runtime would drop its frames):
  the pure **`foldLoginFrame`** reducer lives here (as `reduceExtUi`/`reduceSessionEvent` do — `auth` stays
  presentational), and **`beginLogin(loginId, providerId)`** opens the login (a no-op if a frame already
  created it — the frame can beat the `loginStart` response), **`applyLoginFrame(push)`** folds an inbound
  `provider.login` frame (creating `activeLogin` if the frame arrived first; ignoring frames for a different
  live login), **`clearLoginInput()`** drops the live input the instant a reply is sent (no double-submit),
  and **`clearLogin()`** dismisses it. The **settings surface** state — **`settingsOpen`** +
   **`settingsSection`** (a const-object enum: `Providers`/`Github`/`Appearance`/`Layout`/`Terminal`/`Templates`) with
  **`openSettings(section?)`** (deep-links to a section, defaults to Providers) / **`closeSettings()`** /
  **`setSettingsSection()`** — lives here so the top-bar gear AND the Welcome provider warning open Settings
  to a section without prop-drilling through the shell. The **theme** state — **`theme: ThemeId`** (the
  host-owned selected opaque id; the themes module resolves visual fallback) with **`applyConfig(config)`**
  (folds the server-synced `AppConfig` in from
  `server.welcome` / the `settings.changed` broadcast) — lives here too; it's a **pure value only** (the
  theme-application side-effect is the shell's, keyed off `theme`), and defaults to
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG.theme` until the welcome arrives. **`layoutSettings: LayoutSettings`** rides the same
  `applyConfig` fold (host-owned, defaulted from `DEFAULT_CONFIG`) — the Layout section's read side. Layout
  settings are not a second copy of
  any workspace document: they carry only the portable preset catalog/default and group limit. The
  **toast queue** — **`toasts: Toast[]`** (oldest-first) with **`pushToast(toast) → id`** / **`dismissToast(id)`**
  and the ergonomic **`toast.error/success/info(message, title?)`** helper (wraps `pushToast` so a non-React
  call site — a `.catch` in a fire-and-forget wire call — can fire one) — lives here so any surface can raise
  a transient notification; the `panels/Toaster` renders + times them out (errors persist until dismissed).
  `pushToast` **coalesces an identical live toast** (same variant/title/message — a retried failure returns
  the existing id instead of stacking a twin) and **caps the queue at 5** (oldest drop — the viewport doesn't
  scroll, so the newest must stay visible).
  It's the home for a **rejected wire call with no better place to land** (no chat tab to host an error turn),
  complementing `appendErrorTurn` (which handles the in-chat case).
  The host-wide **`templatesVersion: number`** counter + **`bumpTemplatesVersion()`** (increment) is a bare
  invalidation signal, the same shape as `fsChangesByWorkspace`'s `tick` below — **`panels/TemplatesSettings.tsx`**
  and **`chat/TemplateEditorDialog.tsx`** call it after a `template.save`/`delete`, and the Templates
  settings panel's own lists refetch off it (its `useTemplateList` fetch generation). It is deliberately
  NOT a freshness source for the composer's `/` menu — that fetch runs uncached on every menu open,
  since files also change outside the app where no in-app counter can see (see `chat/SPEC.md`'s Template
  slots section); the store holds only the counter, never fetches. The **live-refresh signal** —
  **`fsChangesByWorkspace: Record<workspaceId, { tick, paths, truncated }>`** with
  **`noteFsChanged(payload)`** (folds a `workspace.fsChanged` push: `tick` increments per frame;
  `paths`/`truncated` are the last batch) — panels select their workspace's entry and refetch on `tick`
  change (the store holds only the signal, never fetches; `applyWorkspaceRemoved` drops a removed
  workspace's entry). The **review slice** — **`reviewsByWorkspace: Record<workspaceId,
ReviewSnapshot>`** with **`setWorkspaceReview`** (a `review.get` read landing) and
**`applyReviewChanged`** (folds a `review.changed` push — full snapshot, idempotent; every client,
including a mutation's initiator, converges here — no optimism); `applyWorkspaceRemoved` drops the
entry; the pending-draft count is a selector (`selectReviewDraftCount`), never duplicated in
components. The **Skills-reload badge** rides the same tick without a separate signal:
  `noteFsChanged` also folds **`skillChangeTickByWorkspace: Record<workspaceId, tick>`** — the tick of the
  most recent *skill-relevant* batch, from the host-authored `payload.skillChange` semantic (`detected` for
  a concrete project-skill path, `unknown` for a genuinely pathless uncertainty, `none` for concrete
  non-skill churn). It is independent of the capped generic `paths`/`truncated` pair, so a large build cannot
  masquerade as a skill change and a skill event after the path cap is not lost; it stays *accumulated* so a
  later non-skill batch never clears it. A fresh watcher's synthetic startup nudge remains conservative
  `unknown`. Transport's centralized skill-load preparation awaits `workspace.watchReady`, folds a duplicate
  unknown fallback unless the watcher was already known ready (the event push may have died during
  reconnect), then captures the load's baseline tick. The newly loaded session stays clean; a real skill
  frame after readiness remains newer than the baseline. Each chat records
  **`skillsSyncedTickBySession: Record<sessionId, tick>`** = the tick it loaded skills at.
  It advances **only when resources are actually (re)loaded against current disk**: a fresh
  `openChatSession`, a disk-only `hydrateSession` attach, and **`markSkillsSynced(sessionId, syncedTick)`** on
  a successful reload (`markSkillsSynced` is **monotonic** — `Math.max`, so an out-of-order reload completion
  can't move the baseline backward — and a **no-op for a disposed session**, so a late completion can't
  resurrect an entry dropped by `closeChatRuntime`/`clearWorkspaceState`). A **live** `hydrateSession` restore
  reuses the server session's already-loaded skills (`getMessages` returns only the transcript, no reload)
  which the client can't date, so it advances **nothing** — the chat stays *conservatively stale* if a skill
  change has been observed, never falsely clearing. That
  `syncedTick` is the workspace tick captured at the **start** of the skill-loading round-trip, immediately
  after the shared `workspace.watchReady` preparation (`selectWorkspaceTick`, snapshot by the caller before
  `session.create`/`reloadResources`/`getMessages`), **not** at completion — so a skill change whose
  `fsChanged` frame folds while the load is in flight (which the load did not see) stays past the baseline
  and keeps the badge lit rather than being silently absorbed.
  The selector
  **`selectSkillsStale(state, workspaceId, sessionId)`** = `skillChangeTick > syncedTick` — store-derived
  (survives `ChatView`'s tab-switch remount) and per-session (a sibling/newer chat that loaded the current
  skills is not flagged; a reload clears only its own). Also **`updateFileTabContent(workspaceId, id, content,
  tick)`** — a `FileTab` carries the `tick` its content was loaded at, so `FilePane` detects staleness
  (`workspaceTick > tab.loadedTick`) across tab switches, and its diff twin
  **`updateDiffTabContent(workspaceId, id, original, modified, tick, loadedTarget)`** — a `DiffTab` follows the same
  staleness contract in `DiffPane`, in **two** dimensions: the fs tick and the review target the two sides were
  read against, written together so neither can outlive the content it describes. The transient
  A **`reveal-tool` `LayoutIntent`** is the arrangement-agnostic request to reveal/focus a singleton
  side tool; the shell layout integration consumes it and resolves the tool's current saved location.
  **`changesRequest`** and **`specRequest`** add an optional path/item target to that reveal and carry a
  browser-local request-time center destination without exposing layout concerns to feature views. Async
  resolution carries the local
  destination group's navigation-clock stamp captured at click time: if later attention overtakes it, the
  tool may still highlight the item but the stale completion cannot steal focus. Both intents are consumed
  after handling so remount/re-read cannot replay a structural open. Two fields remain necessary because a
  gitignored spec belongs to the spec graph, not the git-derived Changes view.
  **`specsByWorkspace`** +
  **`setWorkspaceSpecs`** hold each workspace's `spec.graph` snapshot (fetched by `panels`'
  `useWorkspaceSpecs`, kept fresh on the workspace fs tick) so
  the chat's turn divider can classify a written path as a spec off the very snapshot the Specs panel
  renders — one definition of "this file is a spec", via the **`specPathMatcher(nodes)`** selector; dropped
  with the workspace in `applyWorkspaceRemoved`. `setWorkspaceSpecs` **keeps the previous array identity when
  the re-read found no change** — most fs ticks touch no spec, and a fresh identity would invalidate
  `ChatView`'s matcher memo and re-derive every open chat's whole transcript about once a second.
  **`openDoc(tab)`** caches and places either a resolved **`DocTab`** or a **`PlanTab`** (`kind: "plan"`,
  id `${workspaceId}:plan:${sessionId}` — one page per chat, re-open focuses). The shared layout conversion
  keeps only resolver kind + durable session identity, never cached content. `PlanPane` reads the host-owned
  plan live, so the page has no snapshot to go stale. **`DiffTab`** is a read-only Monaco diff of one
changed file over **one diff scope** (id `${workspaceId}:diff:${scopeKey}:${path}` — one tab per *(file,
scope)*: **the scope is part of a tab's identity**, because a tab's content must never change meaning
because the Changes tool's scope flipped underneath it; the tab carries its own `scope`, which is also what
`DiffPane` re-reads with, never the panel's current one).
**What a tab's identity fixes is *which scope* it shows — the kind, plus the sha for a commit scope.** A
branch-scope tab means "this file vs the workspace's **current** review target", and that target moving —
because commits landed on the branch, or because the user re-pointed it — is the same live-refresh contract
as the worktree changing underneath the tab, not a change of meaning; the target ref therefore does **not**
belong in the tab id (a branch name pins nothing — only a commit sha is immutable, and it is already in the
id). What it *does* require is that the tab re-read when the target moves: `selectDiffTabTargetRef` is that
second live dimension (see `panels/SPEC.md`'s live-refresh contract) — and that the tab **records the target
its content was actually read against** (`DiffTab.loadedTarget`, required, written by every content write).
Panes mount only while their resource is locally selected, so without that record a diff whose target moved
while it sat in the background would mount with the new target already in hand, conclude nothing changed, and show the *old*
target's diff under the new target's label; the cached value is what the mount compares against. Its
per-resource view state: `view` split|inline via
**`setDiffTabView`**, split the default; a markdown diff's `rendered` flag via **`setDiffTabRendered`**
(swaps raw lines for compiled documents — `DiffPane` offers it for markdown paths only); and
`ignoreWhitespace` via **`setDiffTabIgnoreWhitespace`** (Monaco's `ignoreTrimWhitespace`). All three go
through one internal `patchDiffRenderState(state, workspaceId, id, patch)` helper — locate-the-resource-cache
and merge lives once, so a new per-diff toggle is a one-liner, not another copy. Opened by `ChangesPanel`.
**`diffScopeByWorkspace`** + **`setDiffScope(workspaceId, scope)`** hold *what* each workspace's Changes
panel is diffing (read through **`selectDiffScope`**, which defaults to the shared, referentially stable
`BRANCH_SCOPE`); keyed **per workspace**, not app-wide like `changesView`, because a scope belongs to that
branch's review — a commit sha means nothing in another worktree — and dropped with the workspace in
`applyWorkspaceRemoved`. The transient **`chatLocationRequest`** — the history-search jump
  deep link; the requester activates the target project+workspace, the workbench shell integration
  opens/hydrates the target
  chat, `ChatView` consumes + clears — is **`ChatLocationRequest { workspaceId, projectId, sessionId,
  messageIndex, anchorText, navigation? }`**, set by **`requestChatLocation(req)`** (which captures and
  advances an already-hydrated destination group's local clock *before* switching workspaces, and sets `selectedProjectId` +
  `activeWorkspaceId` **atomically**, the same invariant `activateWorkspace` upholds, since the target chat
  can live in a different project/workspace than the one the search ran from — the caller
  `useHistorySearch.openMessage` loads the destination project's workspaces first when absent) and cleared
  by **`clearChatLocation()`**; the target's anchor resolves against the runtime's `turnIdByMessageIndex`
  (see `chat/SPEC.md`'s hydration bullet), falling back to the newest `anchorText` match when absent.
  The sibling transient **`historyOpenRequest { id, sessionId }`** — set by **`requestHistoryOpen(target)`**,
  cleared by **`clearHistoryOpen()`** — carries the shell's app-wide `Ctrl+R` to a chat, which opens (or,
  when already open, re-scopes) its history overlay; it goes through the store precisely because the chord
  fires outside the chat subtree entirely (see `shell/SPEC.md`'s "Global chords"). The target comes from
  **`selectHistoryTarget`** (the locally selected chat, else the workspace's newest chat) and the action
  atomically queues the workbench selection with the request; the request id correlates overtaken cleanup,
  and the intent carries the chat resource so a cache/placement id alias (including an id collision resolved
  by placement-only minting) still selects semantically. That selection deliberately does not focus the tab,
  because the mounted history query owns focus. The shell updates the group's local attention so the target
  body mounts and consumes the request without publishing a structural snapshot. The `EditorTab` (`FileTab`
  | `ChatTab` | `DocTab` | `DiffTab` | `PlanTab`) + `TerminalTab` + `ClosedChat` + `SessionRuntime` types.
  (Chat *render* types + renderers live in the `chat` module.) The pure context
  selectors in `selectors.ts` resolve the active `Workspace`, its owning project id, and the shell's context
  project from those canonical ids and collections; derived active-project state is never stored separately.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `useAppStore`; `selectActiveWorkspace`, `selectWorkspaceById` (the
  one lookup for "the workspace with this id" — `selectActiveWorkspace` is it applied to the active id, and
  `openFileInTab`/`ChatView` read the worktree root through it),
  `selectWorkspaceTerminals` (the host-owned terminal catalog; the layout visibility gate derives mounted
  identities from its supplied document + local attention, while host attachment remains exclusive per terminal),
  `selectActiveWorkspaceProjectId`, `selectHistoryTarget` + `HistoryTarget` (the shell's `Ctrl+R` routing
  target: the locally selected chat resource, or the workspace's newest chat otherwise),
  `selectContextProject`, `selectAttentionCenterTab` (the selected resource in local last center focus),
  `selectCurrentRouteChatTarget` (exact-chat intent only while its workspace and stamped navigation remain
  current), `selectSkillsStale`, **`selectDiffScope` + `BRANCH_SCOPE`** (what a workspace's
  Changes panel is diffing, defaulting to the shared branch-scope constant), **`selectDiffBaseRef`** (the ref
  it is measured against — the client-side mirror of the host's one resolution), **`selectDiffTabTargetRef`**
  (that ref *as an open diff tab's live dimension*: the target for a branch-scope tab, `""` for a
  commit/uncommitted one whose sides can't move — derived here, never re-assembled in a panel),
  `selectWorkspaceTick` (the sync-baseline snapshot), `selectWorkspaceSessionIds` (the deduplicated chat
  layout-reference + history membership used as a reconnect-reconciliation baseline);
  `matchesWorktreePath` (line an agent-reported path — relative or absolute — up against a worktree-relative
  one; shared by the Changes deep link and the spec classifier. The suffix rule is for **absolute reports
  only** and is anchored at a separator: unanchored, `/wt/src/a-foo.ts` would match `src/foo.ts`; applied to
  relative reports, `module-b/SPEC.md` would match the *root* `SPEC.md`) + `specPathMatcher` (is a written
  path a spec-graph node?);
  `selectCatalogModel` (a model ref resolved against the **live** `models` list — a session's own `model`
  is the snapshot it was created with, so host-computed facts on it, today `thinkingLevels`, are read
  through this; callers fall back to the snapshot when the ref has left the catalog);
  `toast` (the fire-from-anywhere helper),
  `Toast` (type), `WorkspaceLayoutSnapshot`/attention selectors and actions, resource render-state types
  (file/diff/virtual-document/plan/chat), `TerminalTab`, `ClosedChat`, `SessionRuntime` +
  `EMPTY_RUNTIME` (ChatView's pre-creation fallback), `ChatLocationRequest` (type), `reduceSessionEvent`.

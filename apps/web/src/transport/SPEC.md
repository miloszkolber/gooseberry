## Responsibility

The single WebSocket client to the host, and its app-wide singleton.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `transport.ts` (`WsTransport`: id-correlated `request` — replies time out after 60s unless the
  caller raises `timeoutMs`, which a request the host answers *only once a human has* must do (an open
  folder dialog: a fired timeout also drops the reply that follows it) —, the **`?client=` page identity** it
  appends to the socket URL (minted lazily and *not* via the secure-context-only `crypto.randomUUID`, so a
  plain-http remote origin still boots; it spans reconnects but not reloads, correlating replayed requests and
  terminal stream routing while host-owned PTY tabs/shells survive and a reloaded page takes them over by
  durable `tabKey`), **reconnect-safe unresolved requests** — a
  frame that was in flight when its socket died returns to the queue and is replayed under the same request id,
  while the host deduplicates `(clientKey, requestId)`, so an accepted mutation cannot become a false failure or
  execute twice —, the two frames that are this side's half of that bargain — **`{ ack: [id] }` receipts**
  (every response read is acknowledged, batched on a microtask; until one arrives the host must assume the reply
  died with the socket and keep it replayable) and the **`{ resume: [ids] }` reconciliation** sent on every
  (re)connect *before* the replays (the complete still-unresolved set, so the host releases everything else).
  Receipts are deliberately best-effort and never retransmitted — one can die in a socket buffer exactly like a
  response can, and the request it named is already gone from `pending`, so nothing would replay or re-ack it;
  `resume` repairs them all at once by restating the truth rather than confirming the confirmations —, channel
  `subscribe` with last-value replay for snapshots; append-only terminal data and the one-shot terminal
  exit/detach + session-deletion + `provider.changed` invalidation channels are never cached or replayed to
  late subscribers, reconnect/backoff;
  `inferUrl` defaults to
  same-origin; **`httpBase()`** derives the host's HTTP origin
  from the WS `url` — for building host HTTP URLs like the `/files/<workspaceId>/<path>` worktree-file
  endpoint the markdown viewer points relative `<img>`s at, targeting the same host the transport dials); `wireTransport.ts` (`initTransport`/
  `getTransport` singleton; routes `server.welcome`, **`project.updated`**, `pi.event`, `pi.extensionUi`,
  **`session.deleted`**, **`provider.changed`**, **`layout.changed`**, **the
  `workspace.created`/`updated`/`removed` lifecycle trio, and `workspace.fsChanged`** into the store — and
  folds every connection transition through
  `setStatus`, whose connected generation gives active-workspace hydration a distinct trigger on every
  reconnect; the complete welcome (protocol + open/recent project views + optional config) via the atomic
  `installWelcomeSnapshot`, whose separate `welcomeGeneration` is the cold-navigation readiness edge;
  project snapshots via `applyProjectUpdated`, `pi.event` via `handlePiEvent(event, sessionId)`, `pi.extensionUi` via `applyExtUi(request)`,
  `workspace.created` via `addWorkspace(workspace)`, `workspace.updated` via `updateWorkspace(workspace)`,
  `workspace.removed` via `applyWorkspaceRemoved(projectId, id)`, `session.deleted` via the idempotent
  `deleteChat(workspaceId, sessionId)` tombstone fold (an online fast path; because this event channel is
  deliberately not replayed, workbench hydration repairs any deletion missed while disconnected from the next
  authoritative `session.list`), `provider.changed` via the atomic store invalidation
  `noteProviderChanged()` plus a `model.list` re-read installed through the store's monotonic provider-version
  guard (the model-catalog hook uses the same guarded write for every list/refresh, so an older reply cannot
  restore a removed generation's models; provider settings observes the same version and re-reads
  `provider.status`), `layout.changed` via a revision-aware store fold (older or duplicate
  documents are not reinstalled, though their echoed mutation ids still settle matching pending writes;
  mutation ids distinguish this client's acknowledgements from remote commits,
  and the shell layout integration cancels an in-progress pointer draft only for a nonmatching accepted
  revision before rendering it),
  `workspace.fsChanged` via `noteFsChanged(payload)`, and
  **`settings.changed`** via `applyConfig(config)` — the post-startup server-synced app config broadcast;
  welcome config lands in the atomic install above. All subscriptions happen once at init, never in
  component effects);
  `errorText.ts` (**`errorText(err, fallback?)`** — normalizes a rejected `request` (the host's error
  string / a timeout / a thrown non-Error) into a short, display-ready line for an error turn/notice);
  `requestError.ts` (**`RequestError`** + **`wsErrorCode(err)`** — a rejection that carries the host's named
  `WsResponse.errorCode`. A coded response rejects with a `RequestError`, everything else (timeout or an unnamed
  host error) with a plain `Error`, so *having* a code is exactly how a caller tells "this
  specific failure" from "the read failed"); `skillLoad.ts` (the one app-integration coordinator for session
  resource loads: single-flight `workspace.watchReady` per workspace; unless the watcher was already known
  ready, fold the conservative `skillChange: "unknown"` wildcard locally as a replay-safe fallback; capture
  the store tick only afterward. Its narrow `prewarmWorkspaceSkillLoad` entry lets a workspace navigator start
  that same preparation before selection without duplicating readiness/fallback policy; failures remain
  retryable by the eventual load. A prewarm preparation is flagged on the wire (`prewarm: true` — the host
  keeps prewarm-only watchers in a bounded, evictable pool) and **never becomes a real load's baseline**:
  the first real load always runs its own real-flagged preparation — answered instantly while the watcher is
  still warm, and re-creating/promoting it (fresh conservative nudge included) when it was evicted — so an
  evicted prewarm can never leave a session on a stale freshness baseline, while prewarms freely ride any
  in-flight preparation and a settled prewarm re-issues (re-warming an evicted watcher on project
  re-selection stays cheap). The wrappers then issue `session.create` / `session.getMessages` /
  `session.reloadResources`, so no call site can accidentally reverse readiness and baseline ordering. The
  `session.getMessages` wrapper also rejects unless the returned summary exactly matches both requested
  workspace and session, making that untrusted-response identity check one shared installation boundary rather
  than a caller convention).
- **Public surface (barrel):** `initTransport`, `getTransport`, `prewarmWorkspaceSkillLoad`, the three
  skill-load-safe session request wrappers, `errorText`, `RequestError`, `wsErrorCode`, `ConnectionStatus`,
  `TransportOptions`.
- **Allowed deps:** `contracts` (method maps, `WS_CHANNELS`, `Project` for welcome + `project.updated`, `SessionEventPayload`
  for `pi.event`, `ExtUiRequest` for `pi.extensionUi`, `Workspace` for `workspace.created`/`updated`,
  `WorkspaceRemoved` for `workspace.removed`, `SessionDeletedPayload` for `session.deleted`,
  `provider.changed`,
  `WorkspaceFsChangedPayload` for `workspace.fsChanged`, `LayoutChangedPayload` for `layout.changed`,
  `AppConfig` for `server.welcome`'s config + `settings.changed`); `store`
  (welcome + event routing — a runtime edge owned by the parent graph); `lib` (plain-HTTP-safe random page
  identity); the browser `WebSocket`.
- **Forbidden:** `server`/`shared`/any `pi` package; importing `panels`/`shell`.

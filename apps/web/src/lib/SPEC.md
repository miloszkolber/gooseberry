## Responsibility

Tiny UI helpers shared across components.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `utils.ts` → `cn()` (merge clsx output through tailwind-merge) + `isMarkdownPath()` (the
  `.md`/`.markdown` gate for the rendered-preview view) + `stripFrontmatter()` (drop a leading YAML `---`
  block so the rendered view doesn't render spec metadata as a heading) + `cssColorToHex()` (canonicalize
  a CSS color to hex — minified CSS serves `#fff`/`gray`-style equivalents, which strict consumers like
  Monaco and xterm reject; `""` when unparseable). Plus the primitives that more than one module needs and
  none should re-state: **`normalizePath()`** / **`isAbsolutePath()`** (a path from a pi tool call or the
  host may use either separator and may be relative or absolute — every path predicate in the app starts
  from these, so `chat`'s display helpers and `store`'s worktree matcher share one definition) and
  **`shallowEqualArrays()`** (element-wise `Object.is` — the "did this really change?" test behind the
  store's snapshot-identity guard and `ErrorBoundary`'s reset keys), **`userText()`** (a user
  message's plain text — shared by `chat`'s transcript hydration/renderer and `store`'s live event
  fold, so "same message" means the same thing everywhere; it lives here because `store`'s edge to
  `chat/` is type-only), **`parseSkillInvocation()`** + **`matchesSkillInvocationCommand()`** (the
  anchored browser-side mirror of Pi's canonical expanded `<skill>` user-message grammar, shared by
  `chat`'s compact renderer and `store`'s optimistic-echo reconciliation; malformed/quoted blocks fail
  closed),
  **`relativeTime()`** (`just now` / `5m ago` / `2d ago` — shared by chat history, the tab strip's closed
  chats, and the Changes scope menu's commit rows; it lives here because `chat/` may not import from
  `panels/`, which is what let three private twins of it accumulate), **`platformShortcutLabel()`** +
  **`hasPlatformModifier()`** (one Apple-vs-other definition for shortcut chrome and global handlers; both
  default to the browser-reported platform but accept an explicit platform string so non-browser callers and
  tests never inherit a host runtime's synthetic `navigator` accidentally), and
  **`copyText()`**
  (clipboard write reporting whether it landed — one place for the *degradation*: an insecure context
  (plain-http remote access) or a denied permission has no clipboard, and every caller's answer is the same
  — do nothing loud, the text stays visible/selectable), **`randomId()`** (16 random bytes through
  `getRandomValues`, which remains available to a plain-HTTP remote client),
  **`DOUBLE_CLICK_SETTLE_MS`** (the one click→double-click arbitration window shared by cached and
  host-read tab opens), and the
  **`LayoutAttention`** device-local overlay shared by store, shell, and the headless layout child, with
  own-property-safe `readLayoutSelection()` / `readLayoutNavigationClock()` accessors for untrusted
  tuple-keyed maps. Also the shared
  Shiki highlighter, **kept out of the barrel** so the eager `@/lib` import stays shiki-free:
  `highlighter.ts` loads the curated grammars + JS regex engine and renders with `themes`' one generic
  CSS-variable registration. It is imported per-file (`@/lib/highlighter`) from lazy chunks only; theme
  identity/palettes never live in `lib`. Collision-safe browser identity composition lives here too:
  **`tupleKey()`** length-prefixes independent strings, **`parseTupleKey()`** reads only its requested
  namespace, and **`layoutResourceIdentity()`** gives every shared placement/cache alias one semantic
  resource key, so delimiters and stable noncanonical placement ids cannot split or alias identities.
- **Public surface (barrel):** `cn`, `isMarkdownPath`, `stripFrontmatter`, `cssColorToHex`,
  `normalizePath`, `isAbsolutePath`, `projectRelativePath` (canonical worktree-relative POSIX identity;
  collapses in-root `.`/`..` aliases but preserves an attempted leading escape for host rejection),
  `shallowEqualArrays`, `userText`, `parseSkillInvocation`, `matchesSkillInvocationCommand`,
  `relativeTime`, `platformShortcutLabel`, `hasPlatformModifier`, `copyText`, `randomId`,
  `DOUBLE_CLICK_SETTLE_MS`, `tupleKey`, `parseTupleKey`, `layoutResourceIdentity`,
  `readLayoutSelection`, `readLayoutNavigationClock`, and the `LayoutAttention` type.
- **Allowed deps:** `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`; `@mewa-code/contracts` (types only — `userText` and
  shared-layout resource parameters); `shiki`/`@shikijs/*` (the per-file shiki modules only — never reachable
  through the barrel).
- **Forbidden:** every app-internal module — this is a leaf.
